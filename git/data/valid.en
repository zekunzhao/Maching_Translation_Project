it &apos;s that pyramid .
in mother &apos;s milk .
it had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the epa .
often what jams us up is sewage .
what do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow ?
stephen palumbi : following the mercury trail
i really thought they were so beneath me .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator , because we couldn &apos;t manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
bj : and mikey also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
mikey brett , craig , leo , zem joaquin and basil and me .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions , for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing .
it may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a convergence of catastrophes , of environmental degradation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pandemics , of poverty .
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc .
the first gentleman , he &apos;s a baker .
so , think of the three settings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office .
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonomously drifting car .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
watch the mental workload , and watch the steering .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighborhoods .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
i mean , literally , her hometown is called whitesville , west virginia .
so these three guys all understand how to productively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
our municipalities , rural and urban , play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal , energy demand , as well as social costs of unemployment , drop-out rates , incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs .
and reading that book made me reexamine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
i went to deaf clubs .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to african-americans and asians come out with creamy skin and yellow hair .
and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family .
the experience of down syndrome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood .
and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is , what do we validate in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reaches across the stove , so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus .
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be sued for it .
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
you want a separate thing , like the ac adaptor .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &apos;d envy or want to do .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i palpably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
so actually now on this website , we have 18,000 people .
and we &apos;re building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
but remember , greece is there today .
and when you think about the economy through these two different lenses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the stakes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that presents a more difficult issue .
the phrase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a postdoc or you &apos;re a professor , a 38-year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an empiricist .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in congress , yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adopt their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
the wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit , the cortex .
where are you feeling this ?
and also triumph , this sense of transcendence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to shamelessly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radiator , which is curved .
no one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes , of these triggers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
now i think it &apos;s too easy .
we have secularized badly , i would argue .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
you need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
but that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
and i say , &quot; of course . &quot; and they say , &quot; so aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole .
you need something like tens of megatons of water -- almost a gigaton of water -- in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino .
the toilets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden shack .
so this is us landing on the ross ice shelf in antarctica .
the fabric alone weighs two tons .
anil ananthaswamy : what it takes to do extreme astrophysics
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scope the problem . how big is it ?
and a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish , a printer , binder and cutter , and kids make their own books .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-library .
the getty here is moving their books to the ucla , which is where we have one these scanning centers , and scanning their out-of-copyright books , which is fabulous .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volume .
we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
so envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
it looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty .
and frankly , i face a big obstacle .
but these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs .
so , fungi and mycelium sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates .
the mycelium , in the right conditions , produces a mushroom -- it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here .
there &apos;s a vetted press release that you can read -- it &apos;s vetted by dod -- if you google &quot; stamets &quot; and &quot; smallpox . &quot;
so , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
too many withdrawals from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
so we had our own miniature rainforest , a private beach with a coral reef .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
we stopped irrigating our soil , as much as we could .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really crank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
i had been growing all my own food .
and all of it was coming from this : shrimp farms .
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
and if you lose where you are in your biosphere , or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
we have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
there &apos;s another sign that we need pit crews , and that &apos;s the unmanageable cost of our care .
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
we got the lead safety engineer for boeing to help us .
there &apos;s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
if you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the postal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-pound packages of bees .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really worried about losing this segment of our industry .
and bees are very faithful .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
but i also want to reinforce some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational .
well actually , i &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whistling since the age of four , about four .
i lost my face .
and i want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
some of them are very easy .
and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
and why are they so similar ?
thank you .
they &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
he gave 2,000 high fives that day , and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick .
and not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
our goal over the next year is to get water canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation , so we can tackle this problem together .
now why am i talking about cows ?
so what i &apos;m proposing is , just as we require reading , writing , arithmetic , american history , so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their creeds , about their texts , their music , their symbolisms , their prohibitions , their requirements .
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only .
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the sheep &apos;s cleverness .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a beneficiary .
and how can we do that ?
i &apos;m talking also about christianity .
yes .
but i wish it were better .
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot;
well , this from &quot; the purpose driven life &quot; -- &quot; the bible must become the authoritative standard for my life , the compass i rely on for direction , the counsel i listen to for making wise decisions and the benchmark i use for evaluating everything . &quot;
now do we really want to commit ourselves to engulfing all the other religions when their holy books are telling them , &quot; don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just satan talking ! &quot;
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening .
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud .
first of all , listen consciously .
and my relationship to especially human-made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
and then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil .
and so we &apos;re like , &quot; we gotta put a video out about this . &quot;
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pairs of hands , each following their own passions , and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
but einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can escape .
this is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
and surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habitable planet .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
well , it has its pluses and minuses .
from the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the western culture .
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran .
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of tehran .
it can &apos;t afford to doubt the person who tends the child .
one person wins .
i will come to it later .
you cannot command compassion unless you become limitless , and nobody can become limitless , either you are or you are not . period .
you act compassionately .
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion .
and let &apos;s pause here .
it &apos;s good for motivated students .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a snapshot exam .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic . &quot;
but there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down stairs .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .
the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair .
and he turned around . and then he divided into six figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her .
but no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
when people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated .
it is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
and actually i &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
this looks like something out of a dr. seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called eye-in-the-sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s unobtrusive .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
edith widder : the weird , wonderful world of bioluminescence
the yellow-green area is the fluids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also antibodies , sugars , hormones , that kind of thing .
it &apos;s an accurate representation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- identical copies of dna .
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromosome is correctly positioned .
humanity is now fully into the techno-scientific age .
during 41 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sadly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-required courses in science because they were afraid of failure .
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
or larger , what &apos;s the role of dark matter in the expansion of the universe ?
humans have lived for much , much longer than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization in small family groups . nomadic hunters bring down rabbits , gathering food .
more recently , that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant proportion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today .
he used the example of a common grazing area in which each person by simply maximizing their own flock led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource .
toyota , instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace , treats them as a network and trains them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors .
what forms of suffering could be alleviated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?
now , i &apos;ll show you a fun app that -- we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at flickr .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
blaise agüera y arcas : augmented-reality maps
this was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
and if you remember the story about sisyphus , sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
what happened ?
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
at the top of the sheet , we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami .
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
and we &apos;re actually cambodians .
this is a picture of what pursat looks like .
but for us it meant freedom .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
so the key here is empathy .
we revised the mental health component of the primary health care services by adding psycho-social care and psycho-social counselors to the system .
when jungian analyst inge missmahl visited afghanistan , she saw the inner wounds of war -- widespread despair , trauma and depression . and yet , in this county of 30 million people , there were only two dozen psychiatrists . missmahl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psychosocial counseling , promoting both individual and , perhaps , national healing .
that &apos;s true of european biofuels .
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capita consumption , 200 or 300 light bulbs per person , and very low population densities .
wind power produces a bit more , 2.5 watts per square meter , but that &apos;s only twice as big as 1.25 watts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind farms , you need wind farms half the area of the u.k.
but the same goes for renewables as well .
next , there &apos;s the heating lever .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 125 light bulbs &apos; worth .
he mentioned four great world orchestras , and the fifth one was venezuela &apos;s youth symphony orchestra .
the structure of el sistema is based on a new and flexible managing style adapted to the features of each community and region , and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class all over venezuela .
from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
think about it , all right ? i &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
behavioral markers matter .
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement .
we are obsessed with this way of thinking .
classic . hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior .
these discoveries of behavioral markers , and behavioral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscope because of our collecting data streams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
it &apos;s achievable . we should do it economically , we should do it morally , and we should do it for quality of life .
we will see 30,000 new infected websites .
this is the market leader in malware distribution , the black hole exploit pack , responsible for nearly one third of malware distribution in the last couple of quarters .
so this is writing out the malicious code , and a few seconds later , on the left-hand side , you &apos;ll see the attacker &apos;s screen get some interesting new text .
what &apos;s really insulting about this is not only does it provide the attackers with access to your data , but when the scan finishes , they tell you in order to clean up the fake viruses , you have to register the product .
a little more searching , and here &apos;s our cybercriminal .
okay ? so you can see a list of wireless networks .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a staggering rate , and that 250,000 pieces of malware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
you all know the story , right .
and that was really cool .
it was extraordinary .
&quot; you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velociraptor : the velociraptor is cool . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
and so he agreed .
and quite frankly , i think if colonel sanders was to be careful how he worded it , he could actually advertise an extra piece .
that &apos;s based on diet intake surveys , it &apos;s based on levels of obesity , it &apos;s based on a range of factors that gives you an approximate guess as to how much food is actually going into people &apos;s mouths .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harvest because of cosmetic standards .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it &apos;s inedible -- but because it doesn &apos;t look appealing . tristram stuart delves into the shocking data of wasted food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronomical union .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names .
&quot; listen , i &apos;m going back to the swamp mermaid . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;
we have names for places where people don &apos;t exist .
blue cheese , ranch , oil and vinegar , thousand islands and house .
now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp .
he &apos;s all murky . there is little kids leaning on his leg , little ghosts flying around . we gotta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentlemen .
prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites .
bottom , all 74 .
i don &apos;t want hidden , i want to see it .
charles fleischer : all things are moleeds
in fact , it was so successful that there &apos;s no way that these days you could make a book like this .
now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant .
they have an informed opinion , but it &apos;s changing so quickly that even the experts don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s going on .
if you have followed diplomatic news in the past weeks , you may have heard of a kind of crisis between china and the u.s.
the first issue : imagine a potential enemy announcing they &apos;re building a cyberwar unit , but only for their country &apos;s defense .
and this coordination may become even trickier with the introduction of cyber weapons .
it &apos;s just a big blue surface .
so if you ever fantasize about going back in time and seeing what a dinosaur looked like , that &apos;s what a dinosaur looks like .
he can &apos;t spin a web anytime ; he &apos;s got to pull his pants down first .
he never seems to settle on any particular girl .
so what i did was i made an adventure strip .
this is what i love about comic strips , you know .
and you hear other people doing the same thing .
in the northwest quadrant of british columbia , an area of land the size of oregon , there &apos;s one road , a narrow ribbon of asphalt that slips up the side of the coast mountains to the yukon .
our goal is not only to help them do that but to encourage our friends , the good people at shell , not only to withdraw from the sacred headwaters , but to move forward with us and join us as we do the remarkable , the extraordinary : set aside a protected area that will be for all time not simply the sacred headwaters of the tahltan people but the sacred headwaters of all people in the world .
594 . let &apos;s give three of them a nice round of applause there .
3481 .
is that 513,284 ?
would you each enter that on your calculator ?
263972 .
sixth -- was that a friday ? audience : yes .
1824 , ok .
audience : three . three .
77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 .
nor am i going to talk about what i think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; silicon snake oil , &quot; or my second book , nor am i going to talk about why i believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
i &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but i want to talk about what i &apos;m doing now . what am i doing now ?
and i looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing -- well , sitting -- in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
kids . kids is what i &apos;m going to talk about -- is that okay ?
and that &apos;s one of the things i thought i &apos;d do right now .
all i need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
there &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
i &apos;m looking out and i &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
whatever it was for you , i bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
we want things that are designed for how they &apos;re used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
thank you .
and they begin an incredible ballet .
and so now i &apos;m going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play , but it &apos;s never just singularly one thing .
if you want to belong , you need social play .
nothing lights up the brain like play .
and the thing that &apos;s so unique about our species is that we &apos;re really designed to play through our whole lifetime .
and his life -- the transformation of his life from deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death -- he become a linguist , a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker .
attendees at meetings don &apos;t know when they &apos;ll get back to the task that they left at their desk .
jh : how do you keep -- and i know you &apos;re part of the scientific research community , and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else -- how do you prevent -- and some of the data that you &apos;ve produced , the good science that you &apos;re talking about you &apos;ve produced , is hot to handle .
hc : and here &apos;s something we have no reference to eat . this is a cigar , and basically it &apos;s a cuban cigar made out of a cuban pork sandwich , so we take these spices that go into the pork shoulder , we fashion that into ash . we take the sandwich and wrap it up in a collard green , put an edible label that bears no similarity to a cohiba cigar label , and we put it in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge you about twenty bucks for it .
so replicating food , taking it into that next level is where we &apos;re going .
this disruptive mentality of what food is would essentially open up the encyclopedia of what raw ingredients are , even if we just swapped out , say , one of these for flour , that would eliminate so much energy and so much waste .
aside from one-person abc mini-bureaus in nairobi , new delhi and mumbai , there are no network news bureaus in all of africa , india or south america -- places that are home to more than two billion people .
so , from both directions , there is kind of , i think , a lack of understanding about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials of his own day , or her own day , which i think artists are obliged to do , is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have .
as he says here , most people answer without any hesitation .
and then a bunch of people who were like , &quot; what &apos;s the big deal ?
and what you &apos;re typing are recordings of your eyes as you &apos;re looking at other peoples &apos; eyes .
it &apos;s always kind of doing a double take : &quot; what ? &quot;
in fact , this is not unique to hiv . the vast majority of viruses come from animals .
they &apos;re searching for bush meat ; forest animals they can kill to feed their families .
but they &apos;re also going to ask you probably a different question .
when we would get to these rural villages , though , what we found out is that no one had television , so they wouldn &apos;t recognize his face .
needless to say in the past these viruses entering into these rural communities might very well have gone extinct .
we were also playing with sms at the time at odeo , so we kind of put two and two together , and in early 2006 we launched twitter as a side project at odeo .
the president himself is our most popular twitter user , although his tweets have dropped off as of late , while senator mccain &apos;s have picked up .
i have no idea what will happen next with twitter .
i was also an early writer , and when i began to write , at about the age of seven , stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read , i wrote exactly the kinds of stories i was reading : all my characters were white and blue-eyed , they played in the snow , they ate apples , how lovely it was that the sun had come out .
so the year i turned eight we got a new house boy .
never mind that i knew nothing about places like namibia .
there were endless stories of mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system , sneaking across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing .
but i also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps .
shortly after he published my first novel i went to a tv station in lagos to do an interview , and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said , &quot; i really liked your novel . i didn &apos;t like the ending .
thank you .
but experts do get things wrong .
this doesn &apos;t mean having to get a ph.d.
but just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise -- whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and ceo &apos;s , but also shop-girls -- yeah .
i &apos;m eating right , i &apos;m exercising every day , i &apos;m keeping my mind active , that &apos;s what the research says you should do .
i &apos;ve always liked to draw , so i &apos;m doing it more even though i &apos;m really very bad at it .
so how would you run a whole country without oil ?
if you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute .
you have the crude oil .
now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon by 2020 , which is our desire .
we went to other countries . as i said we went to denmark .
and the most fascinating thing we &apos;ve learned is that , when you have small problems on the individual level , like the price of gasoline to drive every morning .
and that &apos;s the difference between problems that are additive , like co2 , which we go slowly up and then we tip , and problems that are depletive , in which we lose what we have , which oscillate , and they oscillate until we lose everything we &apos;ve got .
they basically looked at it and said , &quot; car 1.0 we &apos;ll solve everything within the car itself . &quot;
the two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil -- and scale it infinity .
we need to have presidential leadership just like we had in israel that said we will end oil .
teach your children evolution in biology class , and they &apos;ll soon move on to drugs , grand larceny and sexual pre-version .
essentially , it does it by providing a smooth ramp of gradual step-by-step increment .
and the first paper is a standard scientific paper presenting evidence , &quot; iridium layer at the k-t boundary , potassium-argon dated crater in yucatan , indicate that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
and that all stems from the perception of atheists as some kind of weird , way-out minority .
similar figures obtained for belief in personal immortality .
aveling was a militant atheist who failed to persuade darwin to accept the dedication of his book on atheism -- incidentally , giving rise to a fascinating myth that karl marx tried to dedicate &quot; das kapital &quot; to darwin , which he didn &apos;t . it was actually edward aveling .
this has the advantage of a worldwide network of well-organized associations and journals and things already in place .
people are always going on about , &quot; how did september the 11th change you ? &quot;
and computation , storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information , knowledge and culture , in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet .
so , all of that is in the creation of content , of relevance , basic human expression .
you have to hire people who know what they &apos;re doing .
it is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other , and the way information , knowledge and culture will be produced .
this is a story about the fact that people in africa are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders .
we can invite partners who can support us , but we have to start .
so the market is there .
as telecoms sector grew , housing and construction , and i could go on and on . and this is to illustrate to you that once you get the macro-economy straightened out , the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous .
this is better than the performance of many oecd countries .
so that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing .
you know , the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically , it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic .
they basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed .
so that &apos;s why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu .
for the first time , we saw an aids vaccine work in humans -- albeit , quite modestly -- and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago .
let me give you another example .
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
now think of where this leads us .
sb : i think flu is different . i think what happened with flu is we &apos;ve got a bunch -- i just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now .
they &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption .
that &apos;s what the world bank says .
i asked them to name me just 20 .
take any african economy .
these societies are the ibo , the somali , the kikuyus , for example . they have no chiefs .
so , in a nutshell , what we had in traditional africa was a free-market system .
it also means that he will be able to generate wealth .
and if we don &apos;t pay attention to it , it could be a real problem .
that &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong .
thank you .
there &apos;s been kind of a series of epiphanies .
now , i know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- i &apos;m kidding -- but these are the recapitulation slides , and then i &apos;m going to go into new material about what you can do .
there is a carbon calculator . participant productions convened , with my active involvement , the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator .
and in our modern country , the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did .
so the blowout in the gulf is just a little piece of a much larger problem that we have with the energy that we use to run civilization .
if you go to the places where it &apos;s just arriving , like the eastern part of the gulf , in alabama , there &apos;s still people using the beach while there are people cleaning up the beach .
and i learned -- in fact , i confirmed -- the hypothesis that oil and water don &apos;t mix until you add a dispersant , and then they start mixing .
so he moved away from it , turned around a few minutes later , it was right next to the side of the boat again .
and they populate much larger areas .
here they are working .
we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need .
the first offshore drills were called harpoons .
i decided i wanted to make a star .
your genome is the entire sequence of your dna .
i could just go home now .
in order to find connectomes , we have to see all the neurons at the same time .
and so i think we &apos;re ready to tackle one of the most important questions in neuroscience : how are the brains of men and women different ?
it &apos;s absurd .
and that &apos;s why every connectome is unique , even those of genetically identical twins .
because , if the first neurons in the chain are activated , through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons , which are activated , and so on down the line , like a chain of falling dominoes .
if you pay 100,000 dollars , you can arrange to have your body frozen after death and stored in liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks in an arizona warehouse , awaiting a future civilization that is advanced to resurrect you .
it comes from a company in japan called geltech . now go ahead and open it up .
do you have a need for speed ?
ks : some of them automatically unroll like this one .
so here , come on up to the front . all right , so now if you &apos;ll see here -- no , no , it &apos;s ok .
it &apos;s technically called , &quot; shape-retaining property . &quot;
and these dyes change color in response to odors .
the best culinary experience of my life .
not a lot of people are doing it .
they implicated actually , the spanish government , amazingly .
and i thought , ok , excited jew from new york , right ?
now , what happened ?
it &apos;s the indication that it &apos;s the best foie gras .
and this squadron of geese come over .
it &apos;s brilliant , right ?
and i ended up like going down the spices , and finally , it was like , ok , salt and pepper , thinking he &apos;s salted and peppered his liver .
he said , &quot; i think it &apos;s an insult to history . &quot;
and he demanded that the jews supply enough for everyone .
really new .
those fossil fuels have built our civilization .
and whether you care most about profits and jobs and competitive advantage or national security , or environmental stewardship and climate protection and public health , reinventing fire makes sense and makes money .
also last year , bmw announced this carbon fiber electric car , they said that its carbon fiber is paid for by needing fewer batteries .
together , those things can give us the same or better access with 46 to 84 percent less driving , saving another 0.4 trillion dollars , plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively .
and we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends .
our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns -- everything from data centers and chip fabs to mines and refineries .
hourly simulations show that largely or wholly renewable grids can deliver highly reliable power when they &apos;re forecasted , integrated and diversified by both type and location .
it &apos;s fallen by half .
i grew up in bihar , india &apos;s poorest state , and i remember when i was six years old , i remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep .
the first key shift is open knowledge .
and the government is responsive . so for instance , when it was reported on this website that 800 students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption , the department of education in the philippines took swift action .
how do we make sure that development and aid money actually goes to the people who most need it ? sanjay pradhan of the world bank institute lays out three guidelines to help relief efforts make the most impact -- while curbing corruption . one key : connecting the players who are working to change broken systems with the data they need .
what is the life of the owner of this mouth ? in what society &#91; does &#93; this guy live ?
yes , she said , something like that . ok , that means we are at half of the story .
i raise the angle of vision , but it &apos;s still very -- selfish , selfish , egoiste -- yes , selfish .
never forget -- like that , like that .
you must go back to politics , you must go back to radicalization , i &apos;m sorry if that &apos;s not very english .
we give you white pages . invent .
no , we &apos;re having a little fun .
i &apos;m your worst nightmare . i &apos;m your daddy and your mommy .
it &apos;s her language i will learn . &quot;
i was a public school kid in new york city , and i didn &apos;t do well at all .
and that &apos;s the key to success .
and it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people , and i &apos;m sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren , it &apos;s not enough . you &apos;ve got to reach out and back and find kids like mr. cruz who can make it if you give them the structure , if you reach back and help , if you mentor , if you invest in boys and girls clubs , if you work with your school system , make sure it &apos;s the best school system , and not just your kid &apos;s school , but the school uptown in harlem , not just downtown montessori on the west side .
i did it just last week . it was on a tuesday evening down by columbus circle .
they can listen and join the conversation .
giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier .
because everyone was a hero .
platforms like youtube , twitter , facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that , &quot; wow , i &apos;m not alone .
and everyone started to think that &quot; this guy could be my brother . &quot;
this whole page was , again , managed by the people .
it &apos;s actually strength -- it &apos;s power .
thanks a lot .
a six-monther adores the task .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about .
what you see here is the audio result -- no learning whatsoever -- and the video result -- no learning whatsoever .
patricia kuhl shares astonishing findings about how babies learn one language over another -- by listening to the humans around them and &quot; taking statistics &quot; on the sounds they need to know . clever lab experiments show how 6-month-old babies use sophisticated reasoning to understand their world . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so we had this speaker set up , and we had the camera facing it , and lots of lights pointing at the speaker , and i would set up the speaker , put the tiny little crystals on top of that speaker , and we would do this over and over again , and it was until midday that i realized that i had a completely red face because of the lights pointing at the speaker .
and at the same time , it tries to maintain its position above the magnet , and therefore , it creates those amazing-looking structures of channels and tiny little ponds of colorful water paint .
so the images that you saw at the beginning , they are actually a flame stopped in time while it is traveling through the bottle , and you have to imagine it was flipped around 180 degrees .
i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just riven with grief and confusion .
and it was really her strength , i believe , that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur that has been a guiding light in my life .
the very feeling of terror is global .
she stands with 10,000 arms , and in every hand , there is an instrument of liberation , and in the palm of every hand , there are eyes , and these are the eyes of wisdom .
buddhist roshi joan halifax works with people at the last stage of life . she shares what she &apos;s learned about compassion in the face of death and dying , and a deep insight into the nature of empathy .
one plus one gives us two , and one plus four gives us five .
it &apos;s one squared plus one squared plus two squared plus three squared plus five squared plus eight squared . right ?
these are dilemmas i have every day .
but as you can see , when i talk , i speak with an american accent , which you would think as an iranian-american actor , i should be able to play any part , good , bad , what have you .
&quot; and furthermore , it is the thought that counts . &quot;
it &apos;s like a drug deal .
i go , &quot; i &apos;m sorry . then why were you staring at me ? &quot;
now i feel bad about that .
you deceived yourself .
now , as many of you may remember , the red brigades was a terrorist , marxist organization which was very active in italy from the 1960s until the mid-1980s .
i &apos;ll give you an idea .
so , in the end , i took a decision that , in retrospect , did change my life .
this is when we see the birth of the transnational arms organization al qaeda .
these were money taken out to fund the growth of the terror , illegal and criminal economy .
people simply moved their money-laundering activities away from the united states into europe .
now , some of you might be thinking , &quot; hold on a minute . she doesn &apos;t look very much like an ocean rower .
the atlantic rowing race runs from the canaries to antigua , it &apos;s about 3,000 miles , and it turned out to be the hardest thing i had ever done .
it was absolutely wonderful .
well , naturally , you decide to row across the pacific .
fall down nine times , get up 10 .
i eventually made it to hawaii still alive .
we do have alternatives , and we have the power of free will to choose those alternatives , those sustainable ones , to create a greener future .
it &apos;s meant to be a bit of a game .
but any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is , in fact , what you were just talking about , what was going on here , setting up ted , small-scale architecture -- at the present time can &apos;t really happen without a conversation about this , the world trade center , and what &apos;s been going on there , what it means to us .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
this is the work of a firm called shop , and what you &apos;re seeing here , is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park .
lest you think this is all fiction , lest you think this is all fantasy , or romance , these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 , which is a museum in brooklyn , new york , as part of their young architects summer series .
they &apos;re now building a 16-story building on the side of new york , using the same technology .
it &apos;s about bringing nature to the inside .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , what made my dreams so easy to dismiss ?
turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , i said , &quot; yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and i gave him all the wrong answers that i &apos;d written down the night before .
we both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs .
you signed it , &quot; they were wrong . &quot;
the background radiation is simply too static to be able to be seen under the normal spectral analysis .
so please , without further ado .
in the north , the boreal is bordered by the tundra , and just below that , in yukon , we have this incredible valley , the tombstone valley .
that would be a huge , vast metropolitan area , probably much larger than the city of victoria .
and you can see in the context , it &apos;s just a relatively small section of one of 10 mining complexes and another 40 to 50 on stream to be approved soon .
this is a globally significant wetland , perhaps the greatest on the planet .
and we need to all gather together and say no to the tar sands .
since bala himself will be speaking at ted i won &apos;t spend too much time on him here today , except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible .
they frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization , and their home of delhi is a frequent element in their work .
all the grayed-out species disappear .
when you see a diagram like this , i don &apos;t want you to be afraid .
i don &apos;t want gamers to regret the time they spent playing , time that i encouraged them to spend .
i wish i &apos;d had the courage to express my true self .
now , why a game ?
and they even talked about feeling happier , even though they were in pain , even though they were tackling the toughest challenge of their lives .
that would be good , right ?
now that &apos;s worth plus-one mental resilience , which means you have more mental focus , more discipline , determination and willpower .
all right , everybody , that is plus-one social resilience , which means you actually get more strength from your friends , your neighbors , your family , your community .
and when you get there , more than likely , you will not have any of those top five regrets , because you will have built up the strength and resilience to lead a life truer to your dreams .
and if the bleaching doesn &apos;t go away -- if the temperatures don &apos;t go down -- reefs start to die .
and it was exhibited alongside ours .
some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible .
so we ask the question again , &quot; how many straight lines can i draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot;
and you go , &quot; ah ! i can see it . i can feel it .
it turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders .
we live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks , where great minds go to think about the world .
the first example is an extraordinary syndrome called capgras syndrome .
this has never made much sense to me , this argument .
and then the message cascades into the amygdala , and then goes down the autonomic nervous system .
so this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother , no problem .
it sounds like an oxymoron .
you have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle , and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient , derek , came in .
&quot; and move your normal hand . &quot;
&quot; so , can you change the design and put it on my forehead , so i can , you know , do this and eliminate my phantom fingers ? &quot;
this is called synesthesia . galton called it synesthesia , a mingling of the senses .
in all of us , it turns out we are born with everything wired to everything else .
well , it &apos;s one or two mutants .
but -- actually , we have a lot to learn from them , because they &apos;re a very egalitarian society and they &apos;re a very empathetic society .
he &apos;s a bonobo .
none of them are tricks .
ss : forgot to zip up the back half of his backpack .
kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough .
compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard .
dr. sue thinks it &apos;s important to allow such curiosity to flourish .
so we &apos;re sharing tools and technology and language with another species .
on a still bigger scale , we see entire galaxies of stars .
but the unfinished business for 21st-century science is to link together cosmos and micro-world with a unified theory -- symbolized , as it were , gastronomically at the top of that picture .
and more than that , it &apos;s engendering new kinds of change .
and they were inspired not by the young einstein , who did the great work in relativity , but by the old einstein , the icon of poster and t-shirt , who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws .
and i &apos;d like to end with a vignette , as it were , inspired by this image .
the science done by the young einstein will continue as long as our civilization , but for civilization to survive , we &apos;ll need the wisdom of the old einstein -- humane , global and farseeing .
one person wrote in , &quot; when i win , i &apos;m going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top . &quot;
we called them up at night and asked them , &quot; what &apos;d you spend it on , and how happy do you feel now ? &quot;
describe it . how happy did it make you ? &quot;
they had no money , they went to a clinic and i gave her this money . &quot;
what about your work life , which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we &apos;re not with the people we know .
so some teams , we give people on the team money , they spend it on themselves .
it &apos;s actually from yitzhak rabin .
but with the end of the cold war came also the end of the israeli-iranian cold peace .
the ebbs and flows of hostility have not shifted with ideological zeal , but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape .
two days it took the times online to make a map , a mashable map -- we call these things mash-ups -- a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there and have a look and find out whether your bicycle route to work was affected .
the red circles are polling stations , selected by your criteria .
so , if you &apos;ve been involved in that at all , i just wanted to say : whatever you &apos;ve been doing , whether you &apos;ve just been chanting , &quot; raw data now ! &quot;
the united states is lesterland .
it &apos;s for their private interest . in this sense , the usa is worse than lesterland .
block reform .
if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of america , the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of americans , to spread it out , to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone .
there &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we the people , and the republic we must reclaim
or the gallup poll that showed that seven in 10 americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
now when i got out , i was diagnosed and i was given medications by a psychiatrist .
and everyone &apos;s somewhere in the middle .
do you need , for instance , to be as smart as you are ?
and third , they &apos;re all attracted to each other , but they try to keep a small distance apart .
we don &apos;t , however , really understand at a mathematical level .
scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids that explained it , or , you know , a human being &apos;s tendency to see patterns where there are none .
can you hear that ?
and together they submitted a design based on lord foster &apos;s vision , which was -- he remembered as a kid reading flash gordon comic books , and he said that when flash gordon would come to an abyss , he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber .
interviewer : ah ! now , tell me why you had to do this ?
the most dramatic and shocking footage shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people -- apparently rocking from side to side in unison , not only with each other , but with the bridge .
and the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step .
now , imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a great dane .
see , we used to have a lot of apples .
if agriculture hasn &apos;t experienced that , how could it be adapted ?
in rwanda , in the solomon islands .
i think of it as sort of a cathedral .
because , quite literally , if agriculture doesn &apos;t adapt to climate change , neither will we .
this message is given as a public service .
by the way , i must admit , my english is not so good , i didn &apos;t know what is scrotal ; i understand it &apos;s a scrotum .
and i feel very strongly that it &apos;s not good enough for us to have generations of kids that think that it &apos;s ok to look forward to a better version of a cell phone with a video in it .
and i wrote them down and i found out later that every one of them was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation .
these two new airplanes are the same speed as the dc8 that was done in 1958 .
but i think once it does , we will find solutions , and very quickly , you &apos;ll see those resort hotels in orbit .
it went a whole life cycle without competition , took out of service . and we &apos;re stuck back here with the same kind of capability for military fighters and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late &apos; 50s .
i think what we &apos;ll do is we &apos;ll see a successful , very successful , private space flight industry . whether we &apos;re first or not really doesn &apos;t matter .
humanity is building a machine , and this enables us to collaborate in new ways .
the guy in the picture here , i &apos;ll tell you his story .
they came from computer scientists , engineers .
ibm gave away 400 million dollars of software to the linux movement , and that gave them a multi-billion dollar payoff .
you think that social media is about hooking up online ?
people started to learn about things , and when they did , the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled , or frozen , or failing .
well , the murmuration functions to record a number of principles , and they &apos;re basically the principles that i have described to you today .
and these are the vessels of life , and , as i &apos;ll show you , they can also be the vessels of death .
and , in fact , cancers don &apos;t start out with a blood supply .
so , a few years ago , i asked myself , &quot; can we take this one step further and treat other cancers , even in other species ? &quot;
the bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy , or surgery , or radiation available .
and here is a growing list of our antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we &apos;re interested in studying .
so this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer .
i hope i &apos;ve convinced you that , for diseases like cancer , obesity and other conditions , that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator : angiogenesis .
i &apos;ve been doing that for about 10 years .
you know , they might have a solution .
originally i tried to do the words &quot; figure &quot; and &quot; ground . &quot;
and here it is , figure-ground .
i didn &apos;t come up with the original idea . but this is another way i work as an inventor is to create a sequel .
one of these weighs 50 pounds , 30 pounds and 10 pounds .
a lot of people do sudoku . in fact some doctors prescribe it .
that &apos;s the corner of the whole thing .
to be a woman means not to be a girl .
but what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way i have never been emboldened .
i &apos;ve seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles .
and this girl , when she was 17 years old , wore a burqa in afghanistan , and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women , underneath her burqa , with a video .
and she said , &quot; well , now , i need a house . &quot;
i had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .
i can feel what you &apos;re feeling as you &apos;re feeling inside the feeling before .
i know that lipstick means more than show , and boys are super insecure , and so-called terrorists are made , not born .
a father came out of his house to tell his teenage son and his five friends that it was time for them to stop horsing around on the front lawn and on the sidewalk , to get home , finish their schoolwork , and prepare themselves for bed .
we know that eyewitness identifications are fallible .
as you can see , it is at best poor .
he was totally stoic . i couldn &apos;t see a twitch of his eyebrow .
one suggestion is that all of us become much more attuned to the necessity , through policy , through procedures , to get more science in the courtroom , and i think one large step toward that is more requirements , with all due respect to the law schools , of science , technology , engineering , mathematics for anyone going into the law , because they become the judges .
and other mathematicians did the same sort of thing .
and so i finally got to this city , and i &apos;d done a little fractal model for the city just to see how it would sort of unfold -- but when i got there , i got to the palace of the chief , and my french is not very good ; i said something like , &quot; i am a mathematician and i would like to stand on your roof . &quot;
and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this .
and finally , well , isn &apos;t this just intuition ?
so i tracked down one of the folks who makes these things , this guy in mali just outside of bamako , and i asked him , &quot; how come you &apos;re making fractal fences ? because nobody else is . &quot;
and finally , he revealed the truth of the matter .
we &apos;ve focused in the u.s. on african-american students as well as native american and latino .
the last 50 years have seen a revolution in what it means to be a family .
one has lacrosse on the near side of town .
in sutherland &apos;s system , companies don &apos;t use large , massive projects that take two years .
the week we introduced a morning checklist into our house , it cut parental screaming in half .
the word &quot; agile &quot; entered the lexicon in 2001 when jeff sutherland and a group of designers met in utah and wrote a 12-point agile manifesto .
the rest of it &apos;s taken up with &quot; take your elbows off the table &quot; and &quot; pass the ketchup . &quot;
i loved that . spend the time however you want .
so he led us through the process of creating a family mission statement .
the children who scored highest on this &quot; do you know &quot; scale had the highest self-esteem and a greater sense they could control their lives .
you don &apos;t need some grand plan . you don &apos;t need a waterfall .
and we &apos;re talking really small here .
mark shaw : one very dry demo
that movie is so horrible . it promotes such awful pseudoscience .
but it was something he later turned to his advantage .
nt : yes , that was a big mistake .
but they thought that , if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease , it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit .
with parkinson &apos;s disease , and this lady has parkinson &apos;s disease , and she has these electrodes in her brain , and i &apos;m going to show you what she &apos;s like when the electrodes are turned off and she has her parkinson &apos;s symptoms , and then we &apos;re going to turn it on .
the only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this .
so now we are in clinical trials , and are in phase iii clinical trials , and this may become a new procedure , if it &apos;s safe and we find that it &apos;s effective , to treat patients with severe depression .
and indeed , we are able to get these areas of the brain that were not using glucose to use glucose once again .
and if we could figure that out , how can we implement those designs ?
and we told them , of course , they move in another plane as well .
for example , here &apos;s a leg : the clear part is stiff , the white part is compliant , and you don &apos;t need any axles there or anything .
it &apos;s this technique of building the properties into the form .
here &apos;s the gecko running up a vertical surface . there it goes , in real time . there it goes again . obviously , we have to slow this down a little bit .
and if you blow that up , and zoom in 900 times , you see there are hairs there , tiny hairs . and if you look carefully , those tiny hairs have striations . and if you zoom in on those 30,000 times , you &apos;ll see each hair has split ends .
where &apos;s this going ? i think you can see it already .
and i &apos;m in the meeting -- it &apos;s about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in , there kind of needs to be that bio break , and everyone stands up , and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed .
this is hard . i feel guilty sometimes .
and carrie says , &quot; boy , i feel like i didn &apos;t really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic . &quot;
there &apos;s a famous harvard business school study on a woman named heidi roizen .
and i had my hand up with lots of other people , and you took two more questions .
&quot; how am i going to fit this into everything else i &apos;m doing ? &quot;
and it &apos;s not just because people would know where the women &apos;s bathrooms are , even though that would be very helpful .
dentistry might seem -- and i think it is -- many dentists would have to acknowledge it &apos;s somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine .
they wanted to capture one other variable , which was the patients &apos; sense of efficacy .
now here &apos;s what does work : personalized information works .
but it works , and it even has some health repercussions .
god forbid we should use that same standard that we make cap &apos;n crunch live by and bring it to drug companies .
this is our one-page summary .
we use the person &apos;s age and their gender to start to fill in the personalized risks .
anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions : can i have my results ?
it &apos;s not my idea , other people have hit on it , but i &apos;ve tried to take it to some new places .
and agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention , not as a human technology , but as a co-evolutionary development in which a group of very clever species , mostly edible grasses , had exploited us , figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world .
as soon as you start seeing things from the plant &apos;s point of view or the animal &apos;s point of view , you realize that the real literary conceit is that -- is the idea that nature is opposed to culture , the idea that consciousness is everything -- and that &apos;s another very important thing it does .
and you will see , the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year and there will be that much more habitat because we &apos;ve decided ethanol is going to help us .
and the reason he &apos;s waited three days is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day , those larvae will hatch and he &apos;ll have a huge fly problem .
and what i realized when i understood this -- and if you ask joel salatin what he is , he &apos;ll tell you he &apos;s not a chicken farmer , he &apos;s not a sheep farmer , he &apos;s not a cattle rancher ; he &apos;s a grass farmer , because grass is really the keystone species of such a system -- is that , if you think about it , this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads , which is that for us to get what we want , nature is diminished .
it &apos;s filled with lots of different things that , in short , aren &apos;t that fun .
so , the social layer is all about these connections .
to win , all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time .
influence and status .
it can be used in interesting ways .
and communal discovery is powerful because it leverages the network that is society to solve problems .
let &apos;s all build it together , let &apos;s do it well and have fun playing .
there &apos;s a lot of activity in china .
now , each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own .
audience : orkut .
and -- well , i &apos;ll leave you in suspense .
and i don &apos;t know about all of you , but i have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once .
and as a result , we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting , so when you walk into a meeting room now , it lists all the meetings that are happening , you can very easily take notes , and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting .
so the idea is we can make advertising useful , not just annoying , right ?
and our algorithms -- not a person , of course , but our algorithms , our computers -- the related search was , &quot; i am bored . &quot;
this is the second project that i did . it &apos;s a fax machine .
this is the s.s. great western that he built to take care of the second half of that journey .
conversion sound has developed a high quality , ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid for the developing world .
so i &apos;d like to take the idea that rory sutherland talked about , this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things , and take that a little bit further and say that i think the design of participatory systems , in which many more forms of value beyond simply cash are both created and measured , is going to be the major theme , not only for design , but also for our economy as we go forward .
so why design thinking ?
i &apos;m actually really quite interested , and perhaps more interested to know what this community thinks we could work on .
pretty soon , a lengthy discussion ensued , and finally the manager came over to me and said , &quot; i am very sorry . we do not have sugar . &quot;
in one study , which we ran in japantown , san francisco , we brought seven- to nine-year-old anglo- and asian-american children into the laboratory , and we divided them up into three groups .
it leaves little room for interdependence or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility .
they were flooded with choice before they could protest that they didn &apos;t know how to swim .
we all have physical , mental and emotional limitations that make it impossible for us to process every single choice we encounter , even in the grocery store , let alone over the course of our entire lives .
french parents were more likely to say things like , &quot; noah was here for so little time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said that , &quot; it is poetry that is lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant shade of pink . &quot;
well , the three big problems have in common that they are man-made problems but they are controlled by natural forces .
what if the entire boat becomes a point of control ?
an airplane , when you &apos;re moving in this direction , starts to lift , and that &apos;s how it takes off .
they also made it into an instructable , and in less than one week , they had almost 10,000 views , and they got many new friends .
so it &apos;s about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television , or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers &apos; strike .
everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures -- citicorp , penney , rca -- all getting into this big vision .
with considerable trepidation , we undertake to interview this new machine .
and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman .
but it gives you the kind of power that people have , that the audience has , and the reasons these transformations are happening .
ph : it was the dawn of interactive tv , and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits .
and it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet , but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else &apos;s affairs .
i think these ideas are difficult to understand , because when you &apos;re trapped in one paradigm , the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense .
now , as long as we confine this to the education market , and a personal matter between the computer and the file system , that &apos;s fine , but as you can see , it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people .
ted turner : we did the work to build this , this cable industry , now the broadcasters want some of our money . i mean , it &apos;s ridiculous .
that &apos;s about 2,700 fresh , connective links across about 112 million blogs that are out there .
what the entertainment business is struggling with , the world of brands is figuring out .
thanks very much .
but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized , you know , the first job of design is to serve a social purpose .
red drew me into this little composition , optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service &apos;s mailbox , door service , plumbing .
a change might be a typical street corner in san francisco .
but they &apos;re real examples in urbanization and the change that &apos;s occurred in the last number of years , and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers .
he had high leather boots , jodhpurs , an old leather jacket , a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles -- and , inevitably , a white scarf , to flow in the wind .
you had to learn about aeronautics .
so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry .
and the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office , at the work place -- people who worked , and used task seating , a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long .
and why should you get a 20-page manual about how to run a chair ?
all the weight of your upper torso -- your arms , your head -- goes right down through your back , your spine , into those bones when you sit .
you cant hit your elbow on bottom .
well , you could develop flu-like symptoms .
so we must be good at killing mosquitos .
maybe a better product comes along in 20 , 30 years .
so the males will go out , they &apos;ll look for females , they &apos;ll mate . if they mate successfully , then no offspring .
we &apos;ve separated the males from the females .
&quot; could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
this data &apos;s from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
this is how paul did it . he did it with his iphone .
bill davenhall : your health depends on where you live
that links with hotdiggitydog.com.
instead , i &apos;ll be talking about the main cause at the root of this issue , which i will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis .
now , where do we find this phosphorus ?
and because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant , all the rest is lost , we have to add more and more .
it truly is a paradoxical situation .
true symbiosis .
mycorrhiza exists , it works , it &apos;s produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide .
frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall .
so , even a straight line , defined with calculus , is a curve .
so it &apos;s a single calculation for every single component of the building that we &apos;re adding onto .
so , my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs .
so , in vacuum-formed plastic , in fiberglass , and then even at the level of structural steel , which you think of as being linear and modular .
so soybeans have really exploded , showing how trade and globalization are really responsible for the connections to rainforests and the amazon -- an incredibly strange and interconnected world that we have today .
well , that &apos;s not even the worst example in the world .
weather patterns have changed .
and they &apos;re both happening at the same time .
but we can do this , and there are opportunities to make this work .
global pastures cover 30 million km ² .
we need to invest in real solutions : incentives for farmers , precision agriculture , new crop varieties , drip irrigation , gray water recycling , better tillage practices , smarter diets .
that &apos;s his little depot behind him , and he earns twice the nigerian minimum wage .
so the implications of that are vast , because it means that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people — and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world , because people are actually able to earn money and live and thrive , as andrew saboru did .
well , i guess . you know , china has no — — no intellectual property , right ?
robert neuwirth : the power of the informal economy
it &apos;s not a lot different than the one you see on my patient .
and we &apos;ve had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the u.s. military , using these prototypes , that had up to 10 different degrees of freedom including movable hands .
that &apos;s the idea .
so here &apos;s jesse in our first little test with him .
please welcome amanda kitts .
and we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery , including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the u.s. armed services .
now this is a research arm , but it &apos;s made out of commercial components from here down and a few that i &apos;ve borrowed from around the world .
what we do is have the patient go all the way open and think , &quot; what hand grasp pattern do i want ? &quot;
we want to develop these little tiny capsules about the size of a piece of risotto that we can put into the muscles and telemeter out the emg signals , so that it &apos;s not worrying about electrode contact .
when i first met celine , a little over a year ago , she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy , and she was very ill .
how then can we ensure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic ?
if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place .
we &apos;re not paying the true environmental costs of our actions .
i thought i was going to study the social behavior of galapagos penguins , but you already know penguins are rare .
so it &apos;s a real desert for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...
the nice thing is , if you look down here in argentina , there &apos;s no surface oil pollution from this composite map .
but we &apos;ve been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go .
he &apos;s coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting , which he would do to a female penguin .
this is my box up here , and this is the system that works .
border conflicts can derail so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here .
in fact , the world bank predicts that russia &apos;s population is declining towards about 120 million people and there is another thing that you don &apos;t see on this map .
but hold on . this map is 700 years old .
so china is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region .
oil used to be one of the forces holding iraq together ; now it is the most significant cause of the country &apos;s disintegration .
the lesson from kurdistan and from palestine is that independence alone , without infrastructure , is futile .
azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the caucuses , but now with the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan pipeline into turkey , it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west .
even if these regions aren &apos;t part of the e.u. , they are becoming part of its sphere of influence .
south sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011 in which it is very likely to vote itself independence .
but if you look in nature , you see that different kinds of animals can have really different lifespans .
now get out your handkerchiefs here .
and the daf-2 gene encodes a hormone receptor .
so after we made our discoveries with little c. elegans , people who worked on other kinds of animals started asking , if we made the same daf-2 mutation , the hormone receptor mutation , in other animals , will they live longer ?
and the way that they &apos;re switched on is by a gene regulator protein called foxo .
but what we think is that , under conditions of stress , the levels of these hormones drop -- for example , having limited food supply .
a foxo is a protein that we found in these little , round worms to affect lifespan , and here it affects lifespan in people .
but i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
mr : but what you &apos;re talking about here is not extending human lifespan by preventing death , so much as extending human youthspan .
whereas the city of toronto clearly doesn &apos;t want you involved with the planning process , otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly .
they all have heroes who were chosen .
you add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
a questionnaire .
but can an organism like a fruit fly , which is -- it &apos;s a great model organism because it &apos;s got a small brain , it &apos;s capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors , it breeds quickly , and it &apos;s cheap .
and what this quantification showed us is that , upon experiencing a train of these air puffs , the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity which is persistent , long-lasting , and also appears to be graded .
now what &apos;s the causal relationship , if anything , between these phenotypes ?
in fact , there &apos;s only one good thing i can think of when it gets to mosquitos .
that &apos;s right .
and then you see the dog . it &apos;s called tweed . it &apos;s a border collie .
i &apos;m sticking in my arm , i &apos;m giving them a big juicy blood meal , i &apos;m shaking them off , and we follow them through time to see these mosquitos get very , very sick indeed , here shown in fast motion , and three hours later what we see at the bottom of the cage is dead mosquitos , very dead mosquitos , and i &apos;m going to say , ladies and gentlemen , we have swapped the cards with mosquitos .
and the gift of life has been extended from brain-dead donors to living , related donors -- relatives who might donate an organ or a part of an organ , like a split liver graft , to a relative or loved one .
i witnessed the technical difficulty .
in may 2006 , something horrible happened to me .
as we speak , the world &apos;s first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury is currently underway following the usfda approval .
every year in the united states alone , 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
they stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism .
the researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals .
so now you may be wondering , why does anyone get married ever ?
if you look very carefully , you see that his skull has been replaced with a transparent plexiglas dome so that the workings of his brain can be observed and also controlled with light .
we need to rearrange the pattern .
there &apos;s no high-tech gizmos here , just biology revealed through biology .
these headless bodies can live for about a day , but they don &apos;t do much .
now obviously , the critic is a key ingredient in what makes us intelligent .
so this anatomy suggests that the mushroom bodies have something to do with action choice .
gero miesenboeck : re-engineering the brain
this is libby , or actually , this is an ultrasound image of libby .
ed : all right.tb : okay . turn it a little bit inside , a little bit toward the middle for me .
now i personally learned that hospitals can be a very dangerous place at a young age .
i want to use technology that we &apos;re all working on and making happen to make health care a coordinated team sport .
so on my chart , i forced them to put , &quot; patient goal : low doses of drugs over longer periods of time , side effects friendly to skiing . &quot;
let me share with you today an original discovery .
lynn verinsky : because of liability insurance .
even though we put a passive bar there .
but this time what we did is we put a slippery patch that you see in yellow there .
okay , now we wondered , if we were right , we should be able to test this in a physical model , in a robot .
maybe it &apos;s evolved from coming down from trees , and trying to control a glide .
and here is the first active tail , in the robot , made by boston dynamics .
and by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations , a lot of the low-lying states , like kiribati and nauru , they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows .
so anything that influences how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water changes the ocean of the planet .
so that trip just ended , and i can &apos;t show you too many results from that right now , but we &apos;ll go back one more year , to another drilling expedition i &apos;ve been involved in .
it can only get there if it &apos;s carried out by ice .
this is a bleached coral , coral that died during the 1982- &apos; 83 el nino .
i &apos;ll take you back here to the galapagos islands .
we work with tree rings .
it has many consequences .
he proposed that our universe might actually have more than the three dimensions that we are all aware of .
the moon is kept in orbit , according to these ideas , because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence .
he , in fact -- there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim , he read a book , a treatise on swimming -- -- then dove into the ocean .
in detail , for instance , they couldn &apos;t get the mass of the electron to work out correctly in this theory .
it &apos;s built up of a huge number of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy , vibrating in different frequencies .
this is a deep question .
and we think -- and this is , i think , very exciting -- that in the next five years or so we may be able to test for the existence of these extra dimensions .
and one of those dots is the same in the two panels . okay ?
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet , you &apos;re dead . right ?
there is no inherent meaning in information .
but i really want you to learn .
so you see it that way .
your brain doesn &apos;t know . because both are equally likely .
now remember -- -- she &apos;s supposed to be going to the blue flowers .
so not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired , but we can also investigate how people literally make sense of the world .
agreed ? yes ?
the question is , was it worth it ?
we &apos;ve developed this ability because it makes evolutionary sense .
because by definition , news is something that almost never happens .
or two , you can make people just feel secure and hope they don &apos;t notice .
in a primitive and simple world , there &apos;s really no reason for a model because feeling is close to reality .
the two i &apos;m following are surveillance cameras , id cards , quite a lot of our computer security models come from there .
so there was that feeling of lack of control .
compare that to the airbag debate -- probably about 30 years behind .
and we rely on others . we rely on proxies .
but in the long-term , both feeling and reality are important .
it &apos;s not just reality ; it &apos;s feeling and reality .
self-discipline : the most important factor for success .
so we know she &apos;ll be successful . but we have to watch her .
so they elevated it .
so we said over a 20-year time period , the value to the city in increased property values and increased taxes would be about 250 million .
but what really , i think , makes the high line special is the people .
another acknowledgment we &apos;ve seen during these years , recent years , is that very few of these domestic interstate , intrastate conflicts can be solved militarily .
when i first came to afghanistan in 2005 as a foreign minister , i met the commander of isaf , the international troops .
it &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .
but talking can be done in different ways .
i cannot do that unless i send the signals that i will be open to listen to the other side &apos;s signals .
the diplomatic toolbox is actually full of different tools we can use to strengthen our communication .
so , literally , a few minutes before that , i downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation , which is really quite interesting , because it turns out you can model this as something called &quot; poiseuille flow , &quot; and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum .
and somewhere along the line , somebody said , &quot; i know ! let &apos;s cut down the last tree and commit suicide , because we need more identical statues . &quot;
so , i &apos;ll talk about it at a future ted .
but metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field .
so , another random thing i do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence , or seti .
it sounds really dumb , but that &apos;s what it is .
study of the ancient climate is very important .
the other interesting thing that i learned about whale sex : they curl their toes too .
and in particular , you &apos;ve probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body , and if that were only true , it would be great , but it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .
and so the trick is -- unfortunately , we don &apos;t have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome .
and as we did it , we realized this was the basic problem -- that taking the sip of coffee -- that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics .
and if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug , we see that in the blood , they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug .
and of course , it really doesn &apos;t have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system .
so david and i applied to this program and created a consortium at usc where we &apos;ve got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world , from cold spring harbor , stanford , austin -- i won &apos;t even go through and name all the places -- to have a research project that will last for five years where we &apos;re really going to try to build a model of cancer like this .
we &apos;ll go back a little more than a year .
that is in fact what great tribal leaders do .
now , stage one , you &apos;ll notice , says , in effect , &quot; life sucks . &quot;
stage three says , &quot; i &apos;m great . and you &apos;re not . &quot;
this is their lobby .
there was no road map . no one had ever done anything like this before .
in fact , martin luther king &apos;s most famous line was at stage three .
i mean , if i was into boxing , like they were , then my life wouldn &apos;t suck . but i don &apos;t . so it does .
they had people involved who were nobel laureates in economics , who reported being bored .
the architect spent hundreds of hours designing the burnished brass switchplates for his new office tower .
why have we settled so quickly for the sound of its switch ?
as adults we admire the lap from a nostalgic distance .
that &apos;s the end . thank you .
what are its kindred and component parts ?
he &apos;s been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13 , in a car crash that killed his father and his sister .
there is , of course , a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of judaism to repair the world -- tikkun olam .
i want to show you the rest of this photograph , because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word &quot; compassion &quot; in our culture -- we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life , which is messy .
so i will paraphrase einstein in closing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
i felt as if the books needed me somehow , and they were calling out to me and i was forsaking them .
our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts &apos; need for lots of stimulation .
and i often think that they have the best of all worlds .
much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there .
so now i &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
and that &apos;s a lot harder for me , because as honored as i am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural milieu .
or maybe they &apos;re full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
my parents were fanatics about learning , and i &apos;ll come back to that a little bit later .
the internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected .
we really think it &apos;s a phenomenal driver of things , to force us to do things differently , and we look forward to being able to actually , working with so many partners around the world , to be able to reach that goal .
it &apos;s beginning to grow tremendously .
we expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year , and we &apos;re very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education .
i &apos;m often asked , what surprises you about the book ?
i wanted to tell michael before he spoke that i really appreciate what he does , because it makes my life work a whole lot easier .
but everybody &apos;s got -- and i believe in a pluralistic society -- everybody &apos;s betting on something .
when he said the word &quot; species , &quot; he was revealing his worldview .
i know that &apos;s a stereotype . i &apos;ve never met one of them .
so , the good life is not about looking good , feeling good or having the goods ; it &apos;s about being good and doing good .
i want you to give me influence . &quot;
what &apos;s in your hand ?
first , it represented his identity .
and even though you &apos;re only going to be in the nba for a few years , you &apos;re going to be an nba player for the rest of your life .
some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you &apos;re doing , quote , &quot; spiritual things , &quot; like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , confessing or doing something like that .
it &apos;s the minister of defense with whom we &apos;re working , not the minister of education , because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off , in which the people who had been causing , if you will , 40 years &apos; worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived .
you and i didn &apos;t have 10,000 books when we went to primary school .
right , the famous chinese character for picnic area .
you guys are answering the question : how does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
we learn these really bad lessons really well .
but it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
it &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
bioenergy isn &apos;t global warming . bioenergy is something which seems counterintuitive . bioenergy is oil . it &apos;s gas . it &apos;s coal . and part of building that bridge to the future , to the point where we can actually see the oceans in a rational way , or put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or do microwaves or stuff , is going to depend on how we understand bioenergy and manage it . and to do that , you really have to look first at agriculture .
so you take something like this , you burn it , you put it under pressure , and likely as not , you get this . although , again , i stress : we don &apos;t know .
last point , last graph . one of the things that we &apos;ve got to do is to stabilize oil prices . this is what oil prices look like , ok ?
her job , her goal and her calling was not to become the world &apos;s greatest toilet scrubber .
but unfortunately , he died prematurely in 1970 , and so he wasn &apos;t really able to live that dream completely .
it was that sort of heady question about what counts that led me to take my ceo hat off for a week and fly off to the himalayan peaks .
wow , that &apos;s interesting .
i like it .
we &apos;re not asking anything that &apos;s intangible .
we don &apos;t have to choose between inspired employees and sizable profits , we can have both .
it &apos;s because perception is grounded in our experience .
so what is evolution &apos;s answer to the problem of uncertainty ?
but we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . it &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
methods , what did you do ? results , what was the observation ?
it &apos;s forever freely accessible by biology letters .
what &apos;s the point ? the point is what science does for us .
so oil and petrochemicals are not just a problem where there &apos;s a spill ; they &apos;re a problem where there &apos;s not .
recycling of plastic in many developing countries means the incineration of the plastic , the burning of the plastic , which releases incredible toxic chemicals and , once again , kills people .
but guess what ? you &apos;re so clever , but you &apos;re not as clever as a clam .
and so we now get a chance to be truly proud of this movement .
the press calls my particular volantor a &quot; skycar . &quot;
but if you look at that top corner -- the highway system -- you see where we are today . highways are no longer being built , and that &apos;s a fact . you won &apos;t see any additional highways in the next 10 years .
in this case here , we &apos;re flying it remotely , as we always did at the beginning .
if you want to stay alive you &apos;ve got to have backups .
paul moller talks about the future of personal air travel -- the marriage of autos and flight that will give us true freedom to travel off-road . he shows two things he &apos;s working on : the moller skycar and a passenger-friendly hovering disc .
they fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
number one question i get asked .
and what i &apos;m going to do is to show you pretty much what &apos;s here .
almost immediately , though , people ask , &quot; how small can you make this ? can you make this small enough ? &quot;
and think of what that would do for you .
so by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
once it &apos;s completed , i plan to integrate the infinity mushrooms into a number of objects .
what a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that i was then .
and yet , he did not die .
there &apos;s another drug out there .
and they were readily available .
just days before terence died , his oncologist said , &quot; tell terence that better days are just ahead . &quot;
this is a poem about mark antony .
what does this all mean for us ?
you can see the camera on the front . we collect multiple viewpoints , vantage points , angles , textures . we bring all that data back in .
we think about the user interface .
in the last five years , the two countries have begun to converge somewhat in economic growth .
and for the sake of brevity , i &apos;ll call one country country 1 and the other country country 2 .
the economy grows , government accumulates more resources , and the government can invest in infrastructure -- rather than infrastructure being a cause for economic growth .
the reason is you never go and bother to ask the losers who also purchased lottery tickets and didn &apos;t end up winning the prize .
the gap between the two countries in terms of literacy is much more substantial than the data here indicated .
then the issue is , what about the chinese political system ?
why do many people believe that india is still a growth disaster ?
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .
we have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration .
in the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
what happened actually when dunbar kind of looked at the tape is that , in fact , almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab , in front of the microscope .
it will be useful in 2020 .
so these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal , and people start kind of coming into the office and saying , &quot; wow , that &apos;s pretty cool . can i hear ? wow , that &apos;s great . &quot;
and it &apos;s really hard to figure out how to get your missile so that it will land right on top of moscow , if you don &apos;t know where the submarine is in the middle of the pacific ocean .
today account for more than eight percent of the national income .
after all , no one is actually in favor of crony capitalism .
i love the internet . i love my mobile devices .
the result is something that economists alan krueger and miles corak call the great gatsby curve .
we created public education .
i kind of woke up to this bit in the late &apos; 90s when i met this guy .
so we started to realize that we had a problem , and the problem is more serious because of this .
she &apos;s the one he &apos;s looking at , and &#91; she &apos;s &#93; the one he &apos;s coming for . can you see that ?
so that &apos;s the little idea .
peter saul : let &apos;s talk about dying
it wasn &apos;t until i entered high school that i thought , &quot; maybe now , you know -- being a big high school kid -- i can maybe become an active part of this big medical world . &quot;
it seems that cancer is a direct result to injury .
it &apos;s the part of cancer that is the most dangerous .
we use skeletal muscles so much . it &apos;s the one portion of our body -- our heart &apos;s always beating . we &apos;re always moving our muscles .
but when the body is actually initiating a process and we &apos;re calling it a disease , it doesn &apos;t seem as though elimination is the right solution . so even to go from there , it &apos;s possible , although far-fetched , that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy .
i had a sleeping bag .
again , the first one to go to the blackboard to answer questions .
and so , when i got outside , i actually gave the translator some money and said , &quot; please go back and see if you can do something . &quot;
it was not a very nice area of seoul , as there were mud streets outside of it .
a girl whose mother had been a prostitute , and she was a prostitute , and a boy who &apos;d been in and out of jail .
he had three women helping him take care of these kids .
this is a woman who is now working at the orphanage , whose son had been adopted .
we were just like , you know , ah , just full of ourselves .
this has got to be a nightmare , this can &apos;t be happening .
it &apos;s so weird how life just goes on .
so , at this point , natasha doesn &apos;t speak a word of english , other than what little father keene taught her .
kodak hired natasha to be a translator for them at the olympics in korea .
he did that , literally , by replacing the earth with the sun in the center of the solar system , and then with this simple-looking act , he actually launched a scientific and technological revolution , which many call the copernican revolution .
the way we do that , actually , is with a method , which we call the transit method .
but up until , literally , 15 years ago , that was all we knew about planets .
and we can find those that we would call habitable , meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen .
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
you &apos;ve all learned that in school -- how small the earth is compared to the immense universe .
i mean look , you can see the necktie , but you can &apos;t even imagine seeing the size of a little , small atom .
what we are showing here is -- on this axis here , i &apos;m showing percent of infected adults .
and it has -- the steady state is , more or less , one percent of the adult world population is hiv-infected .
it &apos;s not respectful , and it &apos;s not very clever to think that way .
so , what is it then ?
but what we think is that it could be concurrency .
let &apos;s talk about billions .
now you can &apos;t just blame this on imperialism -- though many people have tried to do so -- for two reasons .
which leads me to think that neither geography nor national character , popular explanations for this kind of thing , are really significant .
one , competition .
but at the end of it , you &apos;ve got a hundred acres of land .
any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work .
the first is , can you delete these apps , and are we in the process of doing so in the western world ?
no , we may hang on , despite the huge burdens of debt that we &apos;ve accumulated , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo .
niall , thank you .
spiders use silk for many purposes , including the trailing safety dragline , wrapping eggs for reproduction , protective retreats and catching prey .
and the most studied silk line of them all : major ampullate silk .
specifically , if you look on the vertical axis , that &apos;s stress . if you look at the maximum stress value for each of these fibers , you can see that there &apos;s a lot of variation , and in fact dragline , or major ampullate silk , is the strongest of these fibers .
scytodes doesn &apos;t use a web at all to catch prey . instead , scytodes sort of lurks around and waits for prey to get close to it , and then immobilizes prey by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect .
and a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial or institutional difficulties in arranging group output .
so , i was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged &quot; mermaid parade . &quot; there were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers , all aggregated and then put under this nice , neat name , shown in reverse chronological order .
you arrange the coordination in the group , and by doing that you get the same outcome , without the institutional difficulties .
and by the time we get around here , we get ten or fewer photos , and then there &apos;s this long , flat tail .
the institutional response is , i can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great , that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
the bigger question is , what do you do about the value down here ?
this is so much more important than xbox , but it &apos;s a lot less glitzy .
pro-ana , the pro-ana groups .
and that &apos;s going to happen one arena at a time , one institution at a time . the forces are general , but the results are going to be specific .
and -- and you can get somebody to eat something that &apos;s good for them once , but they won &apos;t eat it again if they don &apos;t like it , right ?
we have to develop the gluten .
three transformations take place in the oven .
because what happens is , bread begins as wheat or any other grain .
i &apos;d call that radical .
it &apos;s still dough . nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do , i think , but not too many .
but we &apos;ve got this bread , and what i did here is to try to , again , evoke even more flavor from this grain , was we &apos;ve added into it the spent grain from beer-making .
just now i was functioning in the role of the interpreter , and there i am , interpreter .
okay ?
i can also understand that sort of implicit criticism in this piece , &quot; s-tog , &quot; which i made when i was living in copenhagen .
i was a bit mischievous . in fact , to make it more interesting , i put a space right in here , and this is the actual title of the piece .
if you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric -- that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
so the question is : what would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
so they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
we don &apos;t have to do anything . all we have to do is learn .
because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
here &apos;s one from cristine legare &apos;s lab .
so when you put four .
so when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
and what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game .
so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to simulate -- not chris specifically , i should say , but humans in general .
so , what you &apos;ll see in a moment is a very simple biped that &apos;s learning how to walk using artificial evolution .
i should add that it &apos;s very simple to add things like hair , clothes , etc . , but what we &apos;ve done here is use a very simple visualization , so you can concentrate on the movement .
again , a push , now this time from the front .
now , here &apos;s another one .
now , i &apos;m showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel , how realistic it can look .
but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds , like there , for example , that tom melcher has shown us .
he &apos;s actually a better dancer than i am , i have to say .
you can draw , as everyone should .
you know the hindus are killing us muslims . be careful . &quot;
i &apos;ve called for tech support again .
one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support , and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website , from users saying , &quot; me too ! &quot; and , &quot; here &apos;s my tale of woe . &quot; i call it &quot; software rage . &quot;
and the technician &apos;s like , &quot; ma &apos;am , you &apos;ve got the mouse up against the screen ? &quot;
where are you going to stick them ? you only have so many design tools .
but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all , which is intelligence . now what do i mean by that ?
on the opposite side of the monitor , a task bar appears , and somewhere in those links -- by the way , not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document .
they &apos;re dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh , but they can &apos;t . they &apos;re locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis .
the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard , not apple &apos;s propriety standard .
and conversely , if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- i say , &quot; piss off . &quot;
and so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologies that we could easily find on the then-early web -- would clearly make a huge difference to that problem .
we get our individual rights by society protecting us from others not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal .
but i wanted to share with you three areas that i &apos;m particularly excited about and that relate to the problems that i was talking about in the wired article .
and i want to give you a specific example of a new material that was discovered 15 years ago .
new ways of making electric transportation .
so if we can address , use technology , help address education , help address the environment , help address the pandemic , does that solve the larger problem that i was talking about in the wired article ? and i &apos;m afraid the answer is really no , because you can &apos;t solve a problem with the management of technology with more technology .
and what we have to do to do that is we have to limit access to certain information .
and i &apos;m a product of that generation , like so many other of my peers .
it &apos;s going to be everywhere we look -- where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it .
so why might it be hard to find ?
so , it &apos;s a very hazardous environment , with co as well , and many other gases .
these organisms we now bring into the lab , and you can see some of them growing on petri plates , and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals that we find on the walls of these caves .
and one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it is to have an intermediary .
did it start there and get transported here ?
1982 , peter gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009 , he did some new tests that were published .
it &apos;s buried treasure .
he wanted to make that which was expensive free .
and normally in a book , you wouldn &apos;t worry about the little bits , but these little bits might contain unique archimedes text .
how were we going to do that ?
well one of the unique texts in archimedes is called &quot; the stomachion . &quot;
he lived for another 10 years , then the macedonian faction caught up with him .
under a creative commons license .
in 1985 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery .
i was really happy when i was done .
when i took the tour , it actually included some opus one , i was glad to see .
even the people who market these clubs -- i mean , they &apos;ll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they &apos;ll say , look , you know , you &apos;re not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs .
i mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
there was one object that i could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 cheval blanc .
and i don &apos;t -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean something that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i was not the only one there who had that reaction .
this is a screenshot from the virtual game world , entropia universe .
but this isn &apos;t the really interesting stuff .
it keeps people engaged .
they think this game is unfair .
you don &apos;t punish failure . you reward every little bit of effort -- a little bit of gold , a little bit of credit . you &apos;ve done 20 questions -- tick .
the word &quot; addiction &quot; is thrown around .
we can use calculated randomness .
but there are a lot of challenges for this .
and we also found bacteria that normally inhabit the gut .
it &apos;s so simple , and we thought , you know , okay , it costs between 20 and 50 bucks to provide school feeding for a year .
and agriculture is where food comes from .
but people do because it &apos;s so cheap , and so our whole food system in the last 30 years has really shifted .
and i think by aligning international advocates that are addressing hunger and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity , we might actually look for long-term solutions that will make the food system better for everyone .
we can only blame ourselves . over the last 50 years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious .
and then only after this is done are you allowed to do this , begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions .
why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation ?
but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected .
it is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director .
here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium .
it &apos;s actually beautiful . there was a rock band .
this is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life .
one such project is about a year and a half old .
so i &apos;ll show you now some of my favorite montages from &quot; we feel fine . &quot;
so i went up there , and i lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here , and photographed the entire experience , beginning with the taxi ride to newark airport in new york , and ending with the butchering of the second whale , seven and a half days later .
this is my studio in brooklyn . this is the arctic ocean , and the butchering of the second whale , seven days later .
these whales are about 40 feet long , and weighing over 40 tons . and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year .
he was playing cops and robbers with his friends , running around town , his wish was to become a police officer .
but all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life , like other people .
her wish was to make a pilgrimage to tibet .
you &apos;re most welcome .
he &apos;s got the overstuffed leather satchel and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag and the tweed jacket with the leather patches , and — — he looks at them , and then in a blink of an eye , he kneels down in front of them , and he starts to say , &quot; you know , listen , here &apos;s how you can do it . look , if you do this -- &quot; and he takes the laces out of their hand , and instantly , he starts tying these knots , and even better than they were doing it , remarkably .
and in those days , my hair was down to my waist , i drove a motorcycle , i was unmarried , i owned a bar , so those were different times .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re probably genetically specified for .
the point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing .
this is an actual text that was done by a non-male person of about 20 years old not too long ago .
slash is used in a very different way in texting among young people today .
you can go even further back .
and many of you out there are the heads of macromedia and microsoft , and in a way those are my bane : i think there &apos;s a great homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think of course , it &apos;s also a great liberating force that makes possible , you know , publishing and so forth , and standards , and so on .
how has this happened ?
if the al-qaeda base was to be established near ghazni , we would hit them very hard , and it would be very , very difficult for the taliban to protect them .
and the reason i &apos;m looking a little bit perplexed in this photograph is i was somewhat frightened , and i was too afraid on this occasion to ask him , having run for an hour through the desert and taken refuge in this house , why he had turned up and wanted to have his photograph taken with me .
or in 2008 , major general champoux to come in and say he would deliver the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
so we need to change that institutional culture .
one of the saddest things about our involvement in afghanistan is that we &apos;ve got our priorities out of sync .
just briefly , what &apos;s your take on the current events there and the intervention ?
so , the technology that i want to talk about is for the third world , for the developing world , but it has , i think , much broader application , because information is so important in the healthcare system .
why do we choose paper ?
so , it works very well there , but it doesn &apos;t work very well when you need more quantitative information .
do they have a common cold ?
you don &apos;t have to send out a doctor , you send out somebody who can just take the sample , and in the clinic either a doctor , or ideally a computer in this case , does the analysis .
and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that .
it measures the absorption of light in a sample the neat thing about this is , you have light source that flickers on and off at about 1,000 hertz , another light source that detects that light at 1,000 hertz , and so you can run this system in broad daylight .
in the south , in the northeast , almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there .
in deciding your vote for president today , was the race we &apos;re looking for people that said , &quot; yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision , &quot; and people who voted for john mccain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone .
so it &apos;s the combination of these two things : it &apos;s education and the type of neighbors that you have , which we &apos;ll talk about more in a moment .
just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you .
but the point is , this is all good news , because when something is predictable , it is what i call designable .
since we &apos;re in edinburgh , i &apos;m a big fan of conan doyle .
and finally , she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand , a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in burntisland . &quot;
this is a very famous painting : &quot; the doctor &quot; by luke fildes .
now i &apos;ve been influenced in this thinking by two anecdotes that i want to share with you .
there was just no way .
and they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation .
and as i wondered what he was up to , his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt , fumbling with his buttons .
i &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
so that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
there &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
it wasn &apos;t till -- huygens had two things .
he charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from mother teresa &apos;s lawyer .
there &apos;s a reversespeech.com web page from which i downloaded this stuff .
and so , he wrote an op-ed piece in &quot; the guardian &quot; about katie &apos;s song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge .
and so if we can do that , then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating aids and hiv and malaria and for preventing avian flu . thank you .
but that hospital was over four hours away , and sevitha didn &apos;t have the means to get there , so her baby died .
in doing this , i believe we can truly bring technology to the masses .
first , about a guy named nathan winograd .
we started with the factory idea : that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory that could churn out change .
the quick little diagram of it is , you &apos;re up here , and you are pushing it out to the world .
not because you force them to do something against their will , but because they wanted to connect .
but let me just try a couple .
what it requires , as geraldine carter has discovered , is to be able to say , &quot; i can &apos;t do this by myself .
and the people he surrounds himself with need the connection .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
essentially first , the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages , but also only in cancer .
and — then reality took hold , and over the course of a month , i got 199 rejections out of those 200 emails .
for me , it &apos;s all about looking at the internet in an entirely new way to realize that there &apos;s so much more to it than just posting duck-face pictures of yourself online .
she was preserved by modesty of the religion she was adorned by the light of the quran shereen el feki : 4shbab has been dubbed islamic mtv .
we &apos;re not talking here about a clash of civilizations .
so what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
in desire , we want a bridge to cross .
wanting them is one thing . needing them is a shutdown , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge .
we can experience that powerful thing called anticipation , which is a mortar to desire , the ability to imagine it , as if it &apos;s happening , to experience it as if it &apos;s happening , while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time .
so i want to draw that little image for you , because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs , we are born with that .
on the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
this is not talking heads , in the picture anyway .
the music works perfectly in that setting .
this is the opera house that wagner built for himself .
according to scott joplin , the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs .
there &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
there &apos;s one other kind of new venue , the private mp3 player .
but this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
i hope that you won &apos;t feel that these few moments with me is not a -- is an anticlimax , after all these tremendous talks that you &apos;ve heard , and addresses , which i intend to listen to every one of them .
but about two centuries before david , the hittites had discovered the secret of smelting and processing of iron , and , slowly , that skill spread .
we can &apos;t get along with other people , even in our own families .
we are a soul .
writing the oldest book in the world was job , and he said , &quot; man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward . &quot;
technology projects the myth of control over our mortality .
she said he never thought of god , never talked about god , didn &apos;t believe in god . he was an atheist .
blaise pascal asked exactly that question in seventeenth-century france .
it can be yours , as well , as you seek the living god and allow him to fill your life and give you hope for the future .
&quot; what i will &quot; i will not dance to your war drum .
this heartbeat is louder than death .
bitches get beat daily .
one woman no longer believes love will ever find her .
poet suheir hammad performs two spine-tingling spoken-word pieces : &quot; what i will &quot; and &quot; break &quot; -- meditations on war and peace , on women and power . wait for the astonishing line : &quot; do not fear what has blown up . if you must , fear the unexploded . &quot;
the night before i left , she came to the room and said , &quot; leymah , don &apos;t leave me here .
countries like america , we &apos;ve heard things like no child left behind .
she takes that money and finds single mothers in her community to send back to school .
we set up a foundation .
all of these girls went to the gold mine , and they were predominantly prostitutes doing other things .
the surprise came at the end . who won ?
it displays the names of the thousands of victims using a beautiful concept called &quot; meaningful adjacency . &quot;
and so while computers alone can catch all but the cleverest fraudsters , catching the cleverest is the difference between success and failure .
the friction in the process did not allow for meaningful results in an operational time frame using humans , pdfs and tenacity alone .
i &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence .
i &apos;m talking about all companies .
how often do you think i have that day ?
but an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective .
the area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city .
and we all pay dearly for solid waste costs , health problems associated with pollution and more odiously , the cost of imprisoning our young black and latino men , who possess untold amounts of untapped potential .
in new york state , robert moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign .
we secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects .
in the post-katrina era , we have still more in common .
ours is a city , not a wilderness preserve . and i &apos;ve embraced my inner capitalist .
use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere .
i thought , why don &apos;t i make her an interactive mother &apos;s day card using the scratch software that i &apos;d been developing with my research group at the mit media lab ?
by writing , be creating these interactive mother &apos;s day cards , these kids were showing that they were really fluent with new technologies .
but coding doesn &apos;t have to be like this .
because as they learn to code , it enables them to learn many other things , opens up many new opportunities for learning .
and he saw this , and he was so excited , he reached his hand out to me , and he said , &quot; thank you , thank you , thank you . &quot;
let me end with just one more example .
cars are a sculpture -- did you know this ?
it &apos;s that same kind of commitment , that same kind of beauty .
i think this one here , there &apos;s a pop song that really describes philippe starck for me , you know , this is like you know , this is like puppy love , you know , this is cool right ?
you know , that &apos;s what i have to do sometimes .
and one of the young women in the project , she was a fantastic lady , she actually built her room in the bathroom .
we spent four hours being told all about vocabulary that needs to be built between engineers and designers .
this cannot be . &quot;
we know more about the patients that enter our clinic now than ever before .
and those post-it notes involve this and other proteins of its class -- so-called bromodomains .
and he obliged us .
what this research taught us -- not just my lab , but our institute , and harvard medical school more generally -- is that we have unique resources in academia for drug discovery -- that our center that has tested perhaps more cancer molecules in a scientific way than any other , never made one of its own .
and one thing i &apos;ve learned in boston is that you people will do anything for cancer -- and i love that .
so we say the universe is expanding .
boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tombstone now -- that really quantifies what entropy is .
in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?
einstein was fond of this idea .
so boltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium .
and the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal .
that empty space lasts essentially forever .
my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .
all sisters , excepting me .
so i decided i would build one windmill for myself .
there are an enormous number of them that we use every day .
then i thought , &quot; why not make a google map , but in the physical world ? &quot;
whatever you &apos;re doing with your hands , it &apos;s understanding that gesture .
the fun part is , i &apos;m going to the boston metro , and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground , right ?
thank you .
that &apos;s fantastic .
and really , this is the reason i came here tonight .
so moving to our second commandment that i wanted to show you .
in this present time today , we only carry 18 percent of our population in high-capacity transportation .
bring infrastructure to the favelas , to the slums , wherever you are .
so osorio , good to be there with you .
we have gps &apos;s in all of our trucks .
now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
and it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries .
people in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape , a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved .
and the plot really thickens when you realize that , unlike other pleistocene tools , the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges .
no , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
but the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment , in a flat , closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones .
another device is called speedstrip .
he &apos;s coming up to the grandstand , fellow federationists .
but potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project .
it was neutral , impassive and even , after a while , strangely companionate and reassuring , although i did notice that its calm exterior sometimes slipped and that it occasionally mirrored my own unexpressed emotion .
well , you have to go over and pour it over him in front of the other students . &quot;
i would set boundaries for the voices , and try to interact with them in a way that was assertive yet respectful , establishing a slow process of communication and collaboration in which we could learn to work together and support one another .
we are unique . we are irreplaceable .
when people have this technology in their hands , you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit , grow your own -- grow your dog , grow your own cat .
so if life could be established out there , it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight -- everything that &apos;s needed .
there &apos;s a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there . and i mean , the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole .
so these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings .
that would be a fun thing to do .
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley , so i wanted to be there , and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
so , we had to design both the light and the light bulb .
and it &apos;s what i call being design driven .
but when nicholas negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the founder of olpc -- came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
it &apos;s actually just launched , actually launched on valentine &apos;s day , february 14 , about 10 days ago .
and i was on a college choir tour up in northern california , and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus , and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains .
composer and conductor eric whitacre has inspired millions by bringing together &quot; virtual choirs , &quot; singers from many countries spliced together on video . now , for the first time ever , he creates the experience in real time , as 32 singers from around the world skype in to join an onstage choir for an epic performance of whitacre &apos;s &quot; cloudburst , &quot; based on a poem by octavio paz .
but you &apos;re young , you could still try again . &quot;
she walked into my office at a time when no one knew where afghanistan was in the united states .
she shrugs when i ask her about safety .
bosnians , croats and serbs find a rare shared space of pride in their history , and lesbor reminds them that the songs one group often claims as theirs alone really belong to them all .
in a now famous cnn clip , you can see them sitting on the ground , their arms linked .
and in most parts of the world , that top is still controlled by men .
i was one of the only kids in college who had a reason to go to the p.o. box at the end of the day , and that was mainly because my mother has never believed in email , in facebook , in texting or cell phones in general .
we still clutch close these letters to our chest , to the words that speak louder than loud , when we turn pages into palettes to say the things that we have needed to say , the words that we have needed to write , to sisters and brothers and even to strangers , for far too long .
you put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat .
&quot; it &apos;s funny , &quot; i said to myself , &quot; you can mingle with the opposite sex at the holy kaaba , but not at the burger king . &quot;
and westerners , europeans or americans , who didn &apos;t know about this before faced this practice within some of the muslim communities who migrated from north africa .
maybe it &apos;s a problem of the political culture , and we have to think about how to change that political culture . &quot;
but not just that ; also democracy , parliament , the idea of representation , the idea of equal citizenship .
you have anti-colonization .
and thanks to that , turkey has been able to reasonably create a success story in which islam and the most pious understandings of islam have become part of the democratic game , and even contributes to the democratic and economic advance of the country .
and that &apos;s because today we can see what &apos;s inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its overall shape .
but one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein .
today i want to talk to you about ethnic conflict and civil war .
but this trend is less unambiguous .
but for many parts of africa , a colleague of mine once put it this way , &quot; the cease-fire on tuesday night was reached just in time for the genocide to start on wednesday morning . &quot;
yet instead of grasping this opportunity , local and international leaders soon disengaged and became distracted by the second intifada , the events of 9 / 11 and the wars in afghanistan and iraq .
third , institutional design .
going down there was like entering a time capsule , and i came out with a different sense of myself in time .
these are diatoms , single-celled phytoplankton with skeletons of silicon ...
and others fly today like echoes of the past .
herd safety came with sharpened senses .
in this stunning slideshow , celebrated nature photographer frans lanting presents the life project , a poetic collection of photographs that tell the story of our planet , from its eruptive beginnings to its present diversity . soundtrack by philip glass .
so we started thinking about that , and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer .
let me tell you that there &apos;s not too many people interested in investing in that , not even the prostate cancer foundation , who we &apos;d raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage .
last year we had 450,000 mo bros spread across the world and together we raised 77 million dollars .
and from that moment i realized that movember is so much more than a mustache , having a joke .
thank you .
eight years later , when he was a young man of 18 , benki left the forest for the first time .
we &apos;re running out of land .
sanghamitra comes from bangalore .
he &apos;s a leaders &apos; quest fellow , and that helps him with his work .
because he thought a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past .
so i think we need succession planning on a global basis .
it &apos;s perceptions , thoughts , feelings , dreams .
and the gymnosophist answered , &quot; i &apos;m experiencing nothingness . &quot;
he heard a very different story .
you dunk it in the river .
take a look .
so , it &apos;s rapidly changing , highly diverse , chaotic , ambiguous , unpredictable .
and there are more than 200 formats , across 50 cities and towns of india .
and based on this , we created a ritual for leaders .
devdutt pattanaik takes an eye-opening look at the myths of india and of the west -- and shows how these two fundamentally different sets of beliefs about god , death and heaven help us consistently misunderstand one another .
&quot; and now i know i am completely competent . &quot;
and what , what are you trying to tell me ? that you — &quot; &quot; well , i have an interest . &quot;
&quot; i love you more than — &quot; all right ! she left the room halfway through his enumeration of his love for her .
what a wimp .
you could have said , looked the kid in the face , and said , &quot; go for it , kid , just like i did . &quot;
if you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not alone .
but that very fact is telling .
there have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000 .
so if you will allow me a little creative license , i will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient &apos;s problem with a physicist &apos;s solution .
but mbi exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors , and therefore , it &apos;s impervious to breast density .
we had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose , and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this .
i was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in chicago , and i was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is .
that is the word that comes to mind .
i know what you like . i know who you are , and that &apos;s even before i look at your mail or your phone .
you &apos;d think with a bunch of smart people we wouldn &apos;t be such suckers just for the pretty phones .
or maybe we punt -- ask the legal department , see what they say .
that &apos;s true no matter what thing you &apos;re talking about .
maybe there &apos;s another way that we can use numbers as the basis of our moral framework .
maybe you think , it &apos;s his phone .
you can &apos;t just take human thinking and put it into a machine .
not right now . wait till i finish talking .
we care what happens in &quot; apocalypse now . &quot;
marketing reduces things . marketing simplifies .
so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive , i create a ball , a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from , and roll , at home or at work , towards aggressive noise , and emits white noise in order to neutralize it .
and this object knows , better than you and probably before you , what you really need .
this one is an antibiotic .
in this guise of living object approach , i like the idea of a kind of invisible design , as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves .
so it &apos;s , for me , a great product .
indeed , this object is a domestic farm , for fishes and green .
see , like this one ?
so before i do that , just one warning , which is that this presentation has been rated &apos; r &apos; by the motion picture association of america .
and it was a perfect drug . you could sell for -- buy the cocaine that went into it for a dollar , sell it for five dollars .
but he hears some voices up in the stairwell , so he climbs up the stairwell .
we got an inside look at the gang , from the very bottom up to the very top .
so what do the wages look like ? so you might be surprised .
now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack -- and i &apos;m not really focusing on the negatives , but really , there &apos;s another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates -- just of random , young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states -- the death rates during crack were about one percent .
it goes back to , you know , the real-real versus the fake-real .
he says , &quot; if we start shooting around there , &quot; -- in the other gang &apos;s territory -- &quot; nobody , and , i mean , you dig it , nobody , going to step on their turf .
you can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board , there is a lot of force , a lot of power .
of course you need to be in physical , very good , condition , so i &apos;m training a lot .
coming off of you ?
and i have an academy , a part of the university of fine arts in berlin .
and what happens is that people , they start to see themselves in this space .
it makes a difference whether you say , &quot; i &apos;m a part of this city .
the small mountains in the foreground , they move more .
how do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality , and also to collectivity , without polarizing the two into two different opposites ?
in 2010 , there was a ted event called mission blue held aboard the lindblad explorer in the galapagos as part of the fulfillment of sylvia earle &apos;s ted wish .
edith widder : oh my god . oh my god ! are you kidding me ? other scientists : oh ho ho ! that &apos;s just hanging there .
my age is three hundred and seventy-two i think with the deepest regret how i used to pick up and voraciously chew the dear little boys that i met i &apos;ve eaten them raw in their holiday suits , eaten them curried with rice , i &apos;ve eaten them baked in their jackets and boots , and found them exceedingly nice . but now that my jaws are too weak for such fare , i think it &apos;s increasingly rude to do such a thing when i &apos;m quite well aware little boys do not like being chewed . little boys do not like being chewed . so now i contentedly live upon eels , and try to do nothing amiss and pass all the time i can spare from my meals in innocent slumber like this , innocent slumber like this . i suppose i owe you an explanation .
she wrote this poem when she was 18 years old in 1888 , and i look at it as kind of a very sweet feminist manifesto tinged with a little bit of defiance and a little bit of resignation and regret .
i still have two minutes .
then we showed it in dolphins , and then later in elephants .
this seems prehistoric now , but this was where we were with technology .
pg : so groom was the subject of the piece .
and so if we could also have this up , great .
josh plotnik : hi , my name is josh plotnik , and i &apos;m with think elephants international , and we &apos;re here in the golden triangle of thailand with the golden triangle asian elephant foundation elephants .
the internet of things tell us that a lot of computer-enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too : appliances that you use around the house , that you use in your office , that you carry around with yourself or in the car .
the idea is this will be -- much like the internet functions as a network of networks , which is vint &apos;s core contribution , this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives , that are wonderful individually , to link them globally .
and the client was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
but more seriously , i was like , okay , these ones work , but it &apos;s not just about me , it &apos;s about people from israel who want to say something .
and suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . so the guys on the news , they say , &quot; okay , let &apos;s talk about this . &quot;
they see images of us , and they see bad images .
just people sending their pictures .
so we basically copied the format of the comic book to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes , how our projects actually evolve through adaptation and improvisation .
as you can see , sometimes a subspecies branches off .
and he said , &quot; shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers , &quot; but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over .
and it sort of shows the difference between these two cities .
when you go to the exhibition , you &apos;ll see the mermaid and the pool .
and he said that he was going to do an apartment block next to a parking structure .
you can &apos;t just say that now i &apos;d like to do a sustainable city in central asia , because that &apos;s not really how you get commissions .
they accumulate the solar energy .
there &apos;s two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on .
and also -- and that &apos;s , of course , where economics gets evil -- to put down what are the things we should not do , first .
and so basically , this has been the copenhagen consensus &apos; process .
of course , you can also see it on the website , and we &apos;ll also talk about it more , i &apos;m sure , as the day goes on .
and just to give you a sense of reference , the u.n. actually estimate that for half that amount , for about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all major basic problems in the world .
the second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
the ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good .
i think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t .
but if we don &apos;t do it , then we can start thinking about where should we start ?
&quot; give me liberty or give me death &quot; is all well and good if you can afford it , but if you &apos;re living on less than one dollar a day , you &apos;re far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy .
today , the united states and china are the two leading economies in the world .
the evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
it &apos;s the refrigerators .
so in a very typical , silly designer fashion , after years worth of work , pretty much all i have to show for it are the titles for the film .
as well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier than if you are single .
one of them is to think without pressure .
so as a fashion designer , i &apos;ve always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
it doesn &apos;t need light .
align it in this direction .
hi . so i &apos;d like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day : our shoes , our handbags , our computers and cell phones .
other subjects came up almost never , including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life : 10 or 15 workers in one room , 50 people sharing a single bathroom , days and nights ruled by the factory clock .
about a year after i met lu qingmin , or min , she invited me home to her family village for the chinese new year .
over the next two years , i watched as she switched jobs five times , eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory .
when you talk to workers , that &apos;s what they want .
hazrat ali is from a poor farming family in swat .
step four : the older members of the taliban , the fighters , start talking to the younger boys about the glories of martyrdom .
i have laid down my life fighting the infidels . &quot;
but in the meantime i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the saturnine system , and visit the enceladus interplanetary geyser park , just because we can .
a squirrel had in fact chewed on my internet .
and they &apos;re tiny . they &apos;re the thickness of a hair .
then you can see the english engineers looking on .
and typically , you would take data , like the data of a pen here , which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3d , and we would pass that data with material into a machine .
but what you &apos;ll notice about all of these products is they &apos;re very , very intricate .
and very hard to even create this by hand .
because , simply , most of us here today don &apos;t know how to create the data that a 3d printer reads .
i &apos;m not sure about you guys , but i &apos;ve had experiences when i &apos;ve walked into a store and i &apos;ve know exactly what i &apos;ve wanted and i &apos;ve searched everywhere for that perfect lamp that i know where i want to sit in my house and i just can &apos;t find the right thing , or that perfect piece of jewelry as a gift or for myself .
while you wait at the dentist , a machine will quietly be creating this for you ready to insert in the teeth .
in that original idea , the concept of jihad is as important to muslims as the idea of grace is to christians .
they had never paid him any attention before -- old man , small mosque -- but now they began to pay visits , and sometimes they would drag him in for questions , and always the same question : &quot; why did you name your granddaughter jihad ?
but if you look closely , they &apos;re not fighting a global jihad .
do we know , do we understand , who killed bin ladenism ?
we don &apos;t have to go back to that .
i was with my friend susan meiselas , the photographer , in the mathare valley slums .
she would go into the city at night with about 20 girls , look for work , and sometimes come back with a few shillings , or sometimes with nothing .
and she said , &quot; what would i miss ?
it turns out , 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
and i earned enough money to pay for my first year of caltech .
and it really needed to get much lower than that to be cost effective .
so we tried to come up with a way of making a non-tracking collector , a collector that would gather much more than one degree of light , with no moving parts .
but , his refinements were incredible .
but if your fuel source is free , then the only thing that matters is the up-front capital cost of the engine .
so you &apos;re reusing your energy five or six times , and that brings the efficiency up between 30 and 40 percent it &apos;s a little known , but brilliant , genius invention of robert stirling that takes the hot air engine from being somewhat impractical -- like i found out when i made the real simple version in high school -- to very potentially possible , once you get the efficiency up , if you can design this to be low enough cost .
each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it .
this is how we would envision a residential application .
two other things that i learned that were very surprising to me -- one was how casual we are about energy .
it &apos;s a big community . it &apos;s such a big community , in fact , that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world .
and this is the tower from below .
what i am always thinking about is what this session is about , which is called simplicity .
so , the premise in the studio was , there are no boundaries , there is no fear .
this is andrew gatz , and he walked in through the door and i said , &quot; you ! sit down there . &quot; you know , i take lots of photos .
they &apos;re not . &quot;
so , once a month for the last year , i &apos;ve been doing a column called &quot; the principles of uncertainty , &quot; which , you know , i don &apos;t know who heisenberg is , but i know i can throw that around now . you know , it &apos;s the principles of uncertainty , so , you know .
&quot; nabokov &apos;s family fled russia . how could the young nabokov , sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair , leafing through a book and butterflies , imagine such displacement , such loss ? &quot;
what is it that we &apos;re actually -- what story are we actually telling ?
i do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the barricini family mausoleum nearby .
and when i was seven years old , all of a sudden , a search party arrived at my home .
i think that it &apos;s important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart .
and i think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us , but that , if we pay attention , we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take .
so if you look , you can see a lot of different machines come out of this . they all move around .
and we &apos;ve actually built a couple of these , and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes .
it &apos;s also carried on migration patterns of wild migratory aquatic birds .
we had evolution over time , and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings : 55 percent of people who have become infected with h5n1 have , in fact , succumbed .
if it were los angeles , is it the mayor , the governor , the president of the united states , the head of homeland security ?
well then what about all the workers ? they won &apos;t go to work if their kids aren &apos;t in school .
a public health survey analyzed the effect that large-scale tamiflu use would have , actually shows it counteractive to public health measures , making matters worse .
most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robustly healthy young adults .
and right now most of the preparedness is deeply flawed .
audience member : some research has indicated that statins can be helpful .
and after circulating around the world came back in a form that was tremendously lethal .
laurie garrett : lessons from the 1918 flu
imagine an electric vehicle that can get you to work -- or anywhere in a six-mile radius -- quickly , without traffic frustrations or gasoline . now imagine you can pick it up and carry it with you . yes , this souped-up skateboard could change the face of morning commutes .
the cards were bigger than my hands .
the clubs were escaping me at each throw .
and a few days later , i was practicing on a single tightrope .
it &apos;s a straight line , which sags , which sways , which vibrates , which rolls on itself , which is ice , which is three tons tight , ready to explode , ready to swallow me .
and i chose to put my wire between the arab quarters and the jewish quarter of jerusalem over the ben hinnom valley .
they must think this guy with this dove , he must have spent years working with him .
i will never forget this music , and i hope now neither will you .
so we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us .
one of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered .
what i do is i bring together scientists and artists of all kinds , and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms ; and we look at nature , we look at trees , we look at the canopy , and we communicate , and exchange , and express what we see together .
if you remember that bald guy , you &apos;ll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks in the pacific northwest old-growth forest is going to take decades and decades to come back .
and so i &apos;m hoping that my husband jack , the ant taxonomist , can perhaps work with mattel to make taxonomist ken .
and they made mistakes , too , just like the children .
we &apos;re moving to what i would think of as a fully connected system , and we have global decisions to make in this system , decisions about climate , about finance systems , about resources . and think about it -- if we want to make an important decision about buying a house , we don &apos;t just go off . i mean , i don &apos;t know about you , but i want to see a lot of houses before i put that much money into it .
but again , when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most , perhaps , the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth , it &apos;s really difficult . so we &apos;re still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information , through leaks .
so that -- yes . yes ! my power pose .
this is the first of two rather extraordinary photographs i &apos;m going to show you today .
now , it &apos;s pretty obvious at this point that there &apos;s this zone here in the middle and that &apos;s the zone that really centers around my own personal pursuit of happiness .
you die also because oxygen toxicity can cause a seizure -- makes you convulse underwater , not a good thing to happen underwater .
in 1994 , i was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers .
but , if we want to go deeper , of course , we need another gas supply .
it &apos;s really a very interesting -- you ever see &quot; the abyss &quot; where ed harris , you know , he &apos;s sinking down along the side of the wall ?
diver 2 : uh , silvertip sharks .
even if you ignore the scientific value of this thing , just look at the monetary value of this thing .
now , we &apos;ve done some back of the envelope calculations , and we &apos;re predicting that there are probably on the order of 2,000 to 2,500 new species in the indo-pacific alone .
because once you &apos;re dead , you really can &apos;t enjoy anything after that .
a program called brain electrical activity mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain .
so if i could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved .
he built the capital over there .
and you know , when i knew him when i was in the office , he would come in from a trip , and he would be in the office for two or three days intensely , and he would pack up and go .
in 30 , 50 years back , it was nothing , only paddy fields , and since we invited him here , he felt that he has got a responsibility .
it &apos;s a story of nations , of ideologies , of territories , and of conflicts among them .
our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances , and theirs might be as well .
it takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us .
we are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process .
today , our signal detection algorithms can find very simple artifacts and noise .
and then , we &apos;d like to augment the automated search with human insight .
this past january , i traveled to a place called wais divide , about 600 miles from the south pole .
they cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections for easier handling and shipment back to these labs , some 8,000 miles from the drill site .
they have to , in fact , make sure this ice never gets warmer than about 20 degrees below zero , otherwise , the key gases inside it will dissipate .
but the new story about oil is the government doesn &apos;t have to force us to do painful things to get off oil -- not just incrementally , but completely -- quite the contrary . the united states , for example , can completely eliminate its use of oil and rejuvenate the economy at the same time , led by business for profit , because it &apos;s so much cheaper to save and substitute for the oil than to keep on buying it .
that seems to make more sense .
this muscle car from toyota : 408 horsepower in an ultra-light that does zero to 60 in well under four seconds , and still gets 32 miles a gallon . i &apos;ll say more later about this .
here &apos;s a handmade mclaren slr carbon car that got t-boned by a golf .
now , when you go through a similar analysis for every way we use oil , including buildings , industry , feedstocks and so on , you find that of the 28 million barrels a day the government says we will need in 2025 , well , about eight of that can be removed by efficiency by then , with another seven still being saved as the vehicle stocks turn over , at an average cost of only 12 bucks a barrel , instead of 26 for buying the oil .
so this is a huge social win , too .
we could rerun that play a lot better now .
we spent two and a half years conducting research ; we spent another year and a half in advance development .
one kind of reviewer is a male gamer who thinks he knows what games ought to be , and won &apos;t show the product to little girls .
brenda laurel : i want to show you , real quickly , just a minute of &quot; rockett &apos;s tricky decision , &quot; which went gold two days ago .
we can , for example , go find miko &apos;s locker and get some more information about her .
and what he really wanted was something by vermeer .
his american interrogators described him as an amicable psychopath .
so take food .
these are stimuli i &apos;ve used in some of my studies .
so one reason why you might like something is its utility .
so let &apos;s go back to art .
i &apos;ve been focusing now on the visual arts , but i want to give two examples from music .
so it was a series of five painful shocks .
it has this bizarre , ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer .
again , every country has somebody like this .
&quot; an australian study in 2001 found that olive oil in combination with fruits , vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings . &quot;
now can anybody spot a flaw in this design ?
but actually in a lot of situations that &apos;s wrong .
and this is the most important aspect of the whole story .
i hope i try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature .
but i would say this : i think that sunlight is the best disinfectant .
and i realized , because the chinese ingratiated themselves with a small ruling class here in the united states who stole all of that money and all of that wealth for themselves .
that &apos;s the warm up .
because they have an entire economic system that &apos;s dependent on that oil -- foreign oil , oil from other parts of the world that they don &apos;t own .
and what you see , something else , the united states , the hub of democracy around the world , they don &apos;t seem to really be supporting democratic countries all around the world .
and you feel something about that -- of course you do .
and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; my god , these christians are coming to kill us . &quot;
and of course , christians back in the united states , or anybody , says , &quot; ah , this is some little , tiny church in the middle of nowhere . &quot;
but some of you do .
what are you feeling and thinking about this photo , about this woman ?
you see , that &apos;s empathy .
thank you .
year after year after year , absolutely incredible .
but what is new is that the greater function of ideas is going to drive growth even more than ever before .
well how else can we create new ideas ?
we will see an einstein in africa in this century .
in kurzweilian terms this is gloomy .
the world is much better equipped to overcome an increase in the price of oil today , than ever in the past , because of what i &apos;m talking about .
as far back as i can remember , i was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there .
the fact is , we don &apos;t know .
but each of these species , even the tiniest prochlorococci , are masterpieces of evolution .
that &apos;s in the united states .
the encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications .
there was a bird that people liked on the east coast called the heath hen .
then the question is , can you reassemble , with that genome , the whole bird ?
another direct result was a young grad student named ben novak , who had been obsessed with passenger pigeons since he was 14 and had also learned how to work with ancient dna , himself sequenced the passenger pigeon , using money from his family and friends .
at the san diego zoo , his frozen zoo has collected the tissues from over 1,000 species over the last 35 years .
so basically , they &apos;re learning how to build on good news .
what are they concerned about ?
stewart brand : the dawn of de-extinction . are you ready ?
a published author of books came to talk to us about what he did for a living .
and my grandfather , he was a wise man , and he saw that as a problem , because he knew that was , like , the one thing i had . i didn &apos;t play sports .
&quot; you &apos;re really good . you know , the school newspaper needs a new cartoonist , and you should be the cartoonist .
and i didn &apos;t understand . he said , &quot; you have a great style .
now , i used to work the weekends at the hole in the wall off-season programming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground , and this kid who was just this really hyper kid , i started calling him &quot; monkey boy , &quot; and i went home and wrote a book called &quot; good night , monkey boy . &quot;
i have 10 picture books out .
architects and designers tend to focus exclusively on these .
this is an area i intend to take on this year .
if education can be likened to watering a garden , which is a fair metaphor , sadly , much of the water is evaporating before it reaches the flowers , especially for some groups , for example , those with hearing impairment .
let &apos;s broaden the perspective a little bit and look at cities .
i love the idea that you can transform , become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective .
all right . let &apos;s start with theater .
and that usually , if you &apos;re a bit extraordinary , if you &apos;re not exactly of human appearance , then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud .
charlie chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music , silence , humor and poetry .
but i also met aluminum mold makers , ammunition producers and all kinds of people .
but i didn &apos;t want you to miss out on this one , because this , well , it &apos;s called &quot; portion-controlled meat cuts . &quot;
and once it &apos;s in the right spot , they remove the outer shell , and the heart valve , well , it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating , instantly .
james comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship .
you were so excited , we just let you go . &quot;
i said , &quot; because you &apos;re on a roll .
how powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks , who were not afraid to think , and who had a champion ?
the problem is , which verbs go in which constructions ?
now , many events can be subject to either construal , kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions , in which you can either pay attention to the particular object , in which case the space around it recedes from attention , or you can see the faces in the empty space , in which case the object recedes out of consciousness .
as when we say we &quot; gather &quot; our ideas , to &quot; put &quot; them &quot; into &quot; words , and if our words aren &apos;t &quot; empty &quot; or &quot; hollow , &quot; we might get these ideas &quot; across &quot; to a listener , who can &quot; unpack &quot; our words to &quot; extract &quot; their &quot; content . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are bribes , polite requests , solicitations and threats so often veiled ?
on the other hand , you want the damn guacamole .
my name is dan cohen , and i am academic , as he said .
so why do we even try to argue ?
it is the dominant way of thinking about arguments .
and i have a question : &quot; well , what do you mean ?
but i have some suggestions , and here &apos;s my suggestion .
they paddle faster , and faster , and faster , until they &apos;re going so fast that they literally lift up out of the water , and they &apos;re standing upright , sort of paddling the top of the water .
and i said , that &apos;s what this is ; this is calcium carbonate .
it &apos;s not slavishly mimicking -- although al is trying to get the hairdo going -- it &apos;s not a slavish mimicry ; it &apos;s taking the design principles , the genius of the natural world , and learning something from it .
because life doesn &apos;t really deal in things ; there are no things in the natural world divorced from their systems .
on the left , this is a brittle star ; it &apos;s covered with lenses that the people at lucent technologies have found have no distortion whatsoever .
there &apos;s a company making a product called lotusan , which mimics -- when the building facade paint dries , it mimics the bumps in a self-cleaning leaf , and rainwater cleans the building .
and he found a way to dry out vaccines -- encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules as the tardigrade has within its cells -- meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated .
because we have to grow the capacity of this planet to create more and more opportunities for life .
none of the women i had grown up with in maryland had graduated from college , let alone considered business school .
so maybe you could interview her . &quot;
they are often ignored because they &apos;re harder to help .
we have so much room to grow .
we are the majority .
for this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
for example : is this evil ?
and so , like many people , we start with a house on a lot , and i &apos;m going to show you a typical construction on the top and what we &apos;re doing on the bottom .
now , if i hadn &apos;t paid attention to embodied energy , it would have taken us over 50 years to break even compared to the upgraded house .
so i did .
so this is betty . she &apos;s a new caledonian crow .
and were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week , these crows , whenever these particular students walked around campus , these crows would caw at them , and run around and make their life kind of miserable .
and as we heard yesterday , that &apos;s the pandora &apos;s box that &apos;s getting human beings in trouble , and we &apos;re starting to see it with them .
the crows learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the coin to come out , put the coin in the slot , and then they get their peanut .
hacker and writer joshua klein is fascinated by crows . after a long amateur study of corvid behavior , he &apos;s come up with an elegant thought experiment : a machine that could form a new bond between animal and human .
and this guy comes up to me , and he &apos;s got tattoos and his ponytail and his baseball cap on , and he had his two daughters with him , and he said , &quot; gov , these are my two daughters . &quot;
well , they &apos;re going to places that have policy , like china .
so you could wait and go through congress , although you should be very impatient .
in our media environment , it &apos;s as if they don &apos;t even exist .
they aggregate around the things they love , the things that they like , and if you think about it , shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories .
and so , if you have any interest in understanding the world , looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start .
i &apos;ll get a lonely , little sentence with real error in it , &quot; yeah , i guess i could come inside , but only for a minute . &quot;
everybody gets heard .
people with spinal cord injuries , like paraplegias , quadriplegias , will often develop a very , very sensitive area right above the level of their injury , wherever that is .
and if you trigger , if you stimulate with an electrode , the precise spot , you will trigger an orgasm .
very heavy hetero guy .
and they decided , being masters and johnson , that they would get to the bottom of it .
and they had the farmers -- there is posters they put in the barn , and they have a dvd .
so possibly , you know , a little more arousing than it looks .
he got together in his lab 300 men , a measuring tape , and a movie camera .
this truly is an at-risk population with very few resources to support them .
this is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes .
i &apos;m from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
yeah . the artist doesn &apos;t really seem to know where to put the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; untitled &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
so after a while i decided to have a little fun , and before leaving the room each day i &apos;d scatter a few things around the space .
and now they &apos;re all in here .
my dad was , which is kind of an interesting way to grow up .
all of us ? designers ?
and i said , &quot; oh , girls , dad is a very important journalist , that just wouldn &apos;t do at all . &quot;
someone making the experience their own .
in fact , the whole technology of sperm extraction for spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian .
hey , the name ajax -- you can &apos;t get much more intentional than that , right ?
today it is the chaos of humanity &apos;s impact on the earth itself that we confront .
and i looked at his whacky pedal mechanism ; he was full of pride over his design .
&quot; nurse ! is this the 28th or the 29th ? &quot;
from my seat , i was looking up at a stone town on a hilltop , bright in the noontime sun , when from behind there was a great bang , as loud and violent as a bomb .
i pitched overhand in a weekly softball game that i started in central park , and home in new york , i became a journalist and an author , typing hundreds of thousands of words with one finger .
i would be less mindful of time and of death , and , oh , i would not be disabled , would not suffer the thousand slings and arrows of my fortune .
it was then that abed resumed at once the tale of woe he had begun over the phone 16 years before .
it was then that god intervened : news on the tv of a car wreck that hours before had killed three people up north .
he was not a particularly bad man or a particularly good man .
i told him the name of that man .
okay . so i &apos;m smiling .
and it was kind of spooky , because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you .
whether it &apos;s nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
isn &apos;t there something shorter ?
because if you do the math , you have a thousand tedtalks , the pay 10 cents each ; you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks , because some of them will probably be , or are , really bad .
i had started out with a thousand tedtalks and i had 600 six-word summaries for those .
sebastian wernicke thinks every tedtalk can be summarized in six words . in this talk , he shows how to do just that -- and less . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that &apos;s like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster .
first off , what is it ?
the list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
an early example comes from the great astronomer johannes kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the sun is 93 million miles away from the earth .
instead the fuel not only generated our big bang , but it would also generate countless other big bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes .
i suspect the latter .
when i saw a piece of technology called kinect -- it was called natal -- i was inspired , and i thought for a moment , maybe it &apos;s possible to address that one problem of storytelling , to create a character which seemed alive , which noticed me , that could look me in the eyes and feel real , and sculpt a story about our relationship .
the cool thing is , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re changing the mind of milo constantly .
peter molyneux : what are you going to do , dimitri ?
you stand up , and you skim the stone .
it &apos;s all been too much for him .
that means milo &apos;s mind , as millions of people use it , will get smarter and cleverer .
the siege went on for three and a half years , and it was a siege without water , without power , without electricity , without heat , without food , in the middle of europe , in the middle of the 20th century .
in 1994 , i briefly left sarajevo to go report the genocide in rwanda .
but there will always be another war . &quot;
i always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer , because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe .
well , while aurora was playing this game , as you saw , and doing a thousand trials a day and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice , we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that aurora was making .
and the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin .
what happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to duke , so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her .
look , you all are very well traveled ; this is tedglobal after all .
he thought , &quot; oh , i can renovate the school .
how many of you think there are more males or more females in the world ?
it &apos;s kind of like the dirty , little secret of poverty , which is that , not only do poor people take in very little income , but also , the income that they take in , they don &apos;t spend it very wisely , and unfortunately , most of that spending is done by men .
but you know , there is progress being made in places like cambodia and thailand .
because she had some damage to her nerves , she crawled all the way -- 30 miles -- to that doorstep , half dead .
and then , when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace , she needed someone to help her do the transport , so she hired her husband .
on the day of her graduation , she said , &quot; i am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat . &quot;
and that is the story of an aid worker in darfur .
and just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that , merely by uttering a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
because this is exactly what our ancestors , the homo erectus , did .
because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it &apos;s fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
and to see why , consider two scenarios from early in our evolution .
language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved .
in fact , it &apos;s a map of facebook friendship links .
and it &apos;s the dilemma that this chinese man faces , who &apos;s language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language , and yet he is sitting at his blackboard , converting chinese phrases into english language phrases .
over a five year period following september 11th , when the american media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders , most notably weapons of mass destruction , i chose to look inward at that which was integral to america &apos;s foundation , mythology and daily functioning .
this is a jury simulation deliberation room , and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror .
and playboy is always in the top few .
it &apos;s called the world church of god .
frederick daye , who is photographed at his alibi location , where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime .
william gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
so i started sketching .
but g.s. industries was fantastic .
google earth goes from this view down to your backyard .
and just being able to visit different places and go through different times , we have data from 1950 to 2050 .
i &apos;m going to go back to today , now , and i want to show you where voyager 1 is .
these routes to happiness haven &apos;t really increased happiness very much .
cortisol floods the brain ; it destroys hippocampal cells and memory , and can lead to all kinds of health problems .
absent from this list , and absent from any discussions of happiness , are happiness in another &apos;s happiness .
dopamine system , the wanting system , is much more centralized .
and being alone is very unnatural to the human .
so clearly there is some effect .
cognitive researcher nancy etcoff looks at happiness -- the ways we try to achieve and increase it , the way it &apos;s untethered to our real circumstances , and its surprising effect on our bodies .
and the animal comes back for a food reward .
if the animal does that , it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs , by the way .
we &apos;re talking now explosives , tuberculosis , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
one approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
now , let &apos;s look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture .
well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched .
neuroscientist vilayanur ramachandran outlines the fascinating functions of mirror neurons . only recently discovered , these neurons allow us to learn complex social behaviors , some of which formed the foundations of human civilization as we know it .
if you actually didn &apos;t realize that plants have sex , they have rampant , promiscuous and really quite interesting and curious sex . really .
okay , so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects .
this is a horse chestnut .
heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
she had to impersonate a man .
well there was a little piece of that women &apos;s health initiative that went to national heart , lung , and blood institute , which is the cardiology part of the nih .
right here , it &apos;s just a focal -- right there .
and we &apos;re about two and a half years into a five-year study .
that &apos;s all stem cells .
but we cannot stop now .
we plate them into dishes that we sometimes call petri dishes .
let &apos;s see how powerful just one of these essentials can be .
tissue engineer and fellow nina tandon is growing artificial hearts and bones . to do that , she needs new ways of caring for artificially grown cells -- techniques she &apos;s developed by the simple but powerful method of copying their natural environments .
so you &apos;ve all , i &apos;m sure , seen time-lapse videos where a flower will blossom as you accelerate time .
of course , my son is learning from his linguistic environment , but the environment is learning from him .
and there &apos;s our nanny by the door .
and you don &apos;t have to now go and instrument living rooms with microphones to get people &apos;s conversations , you just tune into publicly available social media feeds .
that drives tune-in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior .
and i really want you to focus on something as i take you through .
and this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate , and , i also think , the better we can think and collaborate together .
it &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever i &apos;m seeing . &quot;
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall .
this is the first house i built .
after all , it &apos;s not just a question of hygiene , but there &apos;s a possibility of recreation as well .
so don &apos;t put it there .
so you translate that to the building industry , if we have a wall of windowpanes and one pane is cracked , we go , &quot; oh , dear . that &apos;s cracked . let &apos;s repair it .
that &apos;s the difference .
&quot; dan , i just don &apos;t think i &apos;m ready . &quot;
it out-gasses formaldehyde so much so that there is a federal law in place to warn new mobile home buyers of the formaldehyde atmosphere danger .
it &apos;s a pretty quick read .
those kids , they &apos;ll work all summer long , kill themselves , so that they can afford one pair of designer jeans .
early on , contractors come by and say , &quot; dan , you &apos;re a cute little bunny , but you know , this just isn &apos;t going to work .
this is a police photo . that &apos;s actually my car .
it &apos;s a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create , and it &apos;s the first known expression of art on the planet .
i discovered during my recovery the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers is suicide .
neurological damage , 10 years of rehab , requires a long-term perspective .
and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of 79 , which is just below average .
two elements that worked for me here are -- the first is 90 percent , i learned , of head and neck pain is through muscular-skeletal imbalance .
using this technology , the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring .
a radio device is controlling every step i take , and a sensor picks up my foot for me every time i walk .
so i think this one detail went past people really quick .
because what i didn &apos;t say in my talk is this is actually exoskeletal .
i did also an unethical study of the professors of the karolinska institute -- that hands out the nobel prize in medicine , and they are on par with the chimpanzee there .
the africans are the green down here . they still remain here .
and the best projection from the world bank is that this will happen , and we will not have a divided world . we &apos;ll have most people in the middle .
and we have seen how countries move in different directions like this , so it &apos;s sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world .
it &apos;s not the new database you need . we have wonderful design tools , and more and more are added up here . so we started a nonprofit venture which we called -- linking data to design -- we call it gapminder , from the london underground , where they warn you , &quot; mind the gap . &quot; so we thought gapminder was appropriate .
it &apos;s pretty scary . but i think it &apos;s very important to have all this information .
and by the age of 11 , i was no longer going to sunday mass , and going on birdwatching walks with my father .
and this was maurice wilkins . he was trained as a physicist , and after the war he wanted to do biophysics , and he picked dna because dna had been determined at the rockefeller institute to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes .
and so we didn &apos;t build any models , and francis sort of continued to work on proteins .
but wilkins said &quot; no . &quot; rosalind franklin was leaving in about two months , and after she left he would start building models .
most scientists are really rather dull .
well , at that time -- i should go back .
looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars . and the parent of a child with asperger &apos;s disease , the high-intelligence autism , had sent his thing to a conventional company ; they didn &apos;t do it .
and if i had enough money , we &apos;d find them all this year .
now perhaps it &apos;s because no such screenshots actually existed , but suddenly gooseberry wanted to settle .
now this is a tactic that patent trolls are supposed to use on people to get their way .
&quot; i haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
at this moment , i saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes .
this was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected , they could reconnect through this image .
people were terrified of this disease .
and this is the reason : in two countries that hadn &apos;t had this disease for more than probably a decade , on opposite sides of the globe , there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .
so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
there &apos;s over 10 million people , probably 20 million people , largely volunteers , who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime .
but the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict .
but you know i &apos;d love to be able to tell you that umar is a typical kid with polio these days , but it &apos;s not true .
so this morning at about seven o &apos;clock , i decided that we &apos;d try to drive chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from india again , so that you could see something that &apos;s just unfolding today , which proves that the impossible is possible .
but if we blink now , we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease .
we have a big gap in that money . we &apos;re cutting corners , and every time we cut corners , more places get infected that shouldn &apos;t have , and it just slows us down .
and of course , we were stunned for a while , but when we managed to get our wits about us , we looked at it and said , &quot; my gosh , what &apos;s going to happen with that little cub ?
we drowned our pride , i must tell you , which was really serious , and we seized the engine .
dj : the amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it &apos;s going to end .
bj : and on this first hunt , we truly were excited .
bj : and then cheetahs have crashed all the way down to 12,000 .
so this is not just a concern about lions ; it &apos;s a concern about communities in africa as well .
it postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel -- mutually undetectable except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments .
we are evolved denizens of middle world , and that limits what we are capable of imagining . we find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like , when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity at which rabbits and other middle world objects move , and hits another middle world object , like a rock , it knocks itself out .
it &apos;s what &apos;s technically known as a &quot; barchan , &quot; and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction at a speed of about 17 meters per year .
the fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness to input the current variables to its model , while the swallow uses light , is incidental .
we don &apos;t know how many planets there are in the universe , but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20 , or 100 billion billion .
the economically useful way to model a person is to treat him as a purposeful , goal-seeking agent with pleasures and pains , desires and intentions , guilt , blame-worthiness .
overnight , i became a mute quadriplegic at the ripe old age of 40 .
using a mouse cursor i control with my head , these web interfaces allow me to see video from the robot and send control commands by pressing buttons in a web browser .
i would have died .
it &apos;s like a looking glass into a hidden world .
and if we kind of ponder on that , then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself .
that said , it &apos;s been really hard to ignore football for the last couple of weeks .
and what i understand from my brazilian friends is that this guy is just a cliche machine .
and you tend to find topics that are almost entirely african-american conversations .
it &apos;s really difficult for me to listen to fijian music .
so here &apos;s the problem that i &apos;ve been interested in in the last decade or so .
it &apos;s one of these rare cases where the u.s. is actually slightly better than &#91; the u.k. &#93; , because we actually like reading your media , rather than vice versa .
they were doing something much simpler .
who &apos;s going after chinese , which now has 400 million internet users out there ?
i can ask her what to read .
and every week on this television show , dhani travels to a different nation of the world .
so the teacher rings up the parents , and says , &quot; very shocking story from little billy today .
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy .
if you ask about child tax credits , the future of the penguins in the south antarctic , asked to hold forth on whether or not the developments in chongqing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture , and we will have an answer for you .
so , let me present the question to you : if our benchmark for americanness is apple pie , you should ask yourself , how often do you eat apple pie , versus how often do you eat chinese food . right ?
well , the short answer is , we locked up all the japanese during world war ii , including those that made fortune cookies , so that &apos;s the time when the chinese moved in , kind of saw a market opportunity and took over .
because it doesn &apos;t look like chinese food to them .
this is actually in the library of congress ; it is a pamphlet published by samuel gompers , hero of our american labor movement , and it &apos;s called , &quot; some reason for chinese exclusion : meat versus rice : american manhood against asiatic coolieism : which shall survive ?
this is a dish called magic bowl that i discovered .
but it was true , and basically , of those 110 people , and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie .
so , the thing is , our historical lore , because of the way we like narratives , are full of vast characters such as , you know , howard schultz of starbucks and ray kroc with mcdonald &apos;s and asa chandler with coca-cola .
so they got very interested in producing convulsions , measured types of convulsions .
and then in the 1950s , late 1950s , the so-called muscle relaxants were developed by pharmacologists , and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion , an electroencephalographic convulsion -- you could see it on the brain waves -- without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes .
as my referrals began to decrease , i clearly became increasingly depressed until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
and there were particular numbers that every time i saw them , just got me dreadfully upset -- all kinds of ritualistic observances , just awful , awful stuff .
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
well , you know , it &apos;s been a wonderful life .
and for those who are older , who have lived through perhaps not something as bad as this , but who have lived through difficult times , perhaps where they lost everything , as i did , and started out all over again , some of these things will seem very familiar .
when you actually look at the motor of the world economy , it cannot move forward unless there is trade between the different countries .
so , you &apos;re on vacation at a nice beach , and word comes through that there &apos;s been a massive earthquake and that there is a tsunami advancing on the beach .
you &apos;re building on people &apos;s ideas and values -- that perhaps they &apos;re candles that burn very dimly on certain occasions .
the idea of the responsibility to protect all individuals who are in situations where they are at humanitarian risk is now being established as a principle which governs the world .
i certainly have been putting forward proposals that would have allowed the poorest parts of the world to feel that we have taken into account their specific needs .
thank you .
and so we get this starting material .
and you can think of different formats .
silk , during its self-assembly process , acts like a cocoon for biological matter .
the bot , our rising celebrity , also has his own twitter account : @ robotinthewild .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
first , let &apos;s make sure he &apos;s dead . &quot;
it &apos;s a norm . it &apos;s a social norm .
we can reach them . there are paths that enable us to reach them .
how might we think differently about our relations with people ?
anyway , he was a photographer and a street educator , and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly .
these are mine , i was born an argentinean .
his family was jewish , so they were hounded .
anyway , he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output .
time passed , and they thought he had surely forgotten them , at first .
all my childhood , while my friends &apos; dads would tell them grimm &apos;s fairy tales , my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles .
it &apos;s a very important period -- it &apos;s roughly half the period when we &apos;ve been fully modern humans on the planet .
simultaneously , they branch off in the mid-50s , 10 years after the second world war , showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise starts in the mid-50s .
and this is the new paradigm , which we gathered two , three years back , recognizing that our old paradigm of just analyzing and pushing and predicting parameters into the future , aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts , is of the past .
now the question then is : how gloomy is this ?
we need nothing less than a new green revolution , and the planet boundaries shows that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink .
thank you .
it was very -- actually , it was a very good study , and got me a job in an ad agency .
this is the ashanti joystick .
and your eye doesn &apos;t know which level to read .
it was just the name of the child , with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly .
so you can see the surface of every single swatch -- like in this picture of chuck close .
actually , i once paid like 60 dollars to see a very great actor to do a version of &quot; king lear , &quot; and i felt really robbed , because by the time the actor started being king lear , he stopped being the great actor that i had paid money to see .
the two human dna sequences go back to a common ancestor quite recently .
they &apos;ve sequenced 185 africans from two populations in africa .
so an interesting question is , what happened when we met ?
so that today , the people living outside africa have about two and a half percent of their dna from neanderthals .
we learn perhaps many things , but one thing that i find sort of important to mention is that i think the lesson is that we have always mixed .
so what we need is space inside the aircraft , inside a very dense area .
so this technology , 3d printing , and new design rules really help us to reduce the weight , which is the biggest issue in aircraft design , because it &apos;s directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions .
we intuit other people &apos;s feelings .
and it &apos;s out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind , the social mind , the social brain , depends on .
now , for this girl , that division line is not so clear , and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like .
and yet , the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years , and in disadvantaged populations , the populations that don &apos;t have access to clinical services , rural populations , minorities , the age of diagnosis is later still , which is almost as if i were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe .
in this scan pass , in green here , are two-year-olds with autism .
and we want to do that universally so that we don &apos;t miss any child , but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention , for treatment .
and then a jumpmaster comes , and he &apos;s an experienced nco in parachute operations .
so nice air comes flowing in .
in 30-some years of jumping , i never did one .
but then a couple of years later , when i was a company commander , i went out to the national training center .
an emerging opportunity came -- didn &apos;t have time to get everybody together .
and yet , again , you &apos;re not all in one room .
think about it . it &apos;s extraordinarily powerful .
my overall project is about art -- specifically , about black artists -- very generally about the way in which art can change the way we think about culture and ourselves .
this is harlem , actually , on january 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way .
really , most exciting about this is thinking about the energy and the excitement that young artists can bring .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement up there .
so the children said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
they are trying to multiply , i think .
&quot; did you understand anything ? &quot; &quot; no , nothing . &quot;
what is that ? can you do that again ? can you show me some more ? &apos; &quot; she did that for two months .
the average score when i &apos;d done it with the computers and the groups was 76 percent .
they wanted to be footballers before .
this sent shivers up my spine .
and i was in a village where there was an initiation ceremony for the young men , a rite of passage .
you saw many examples of my work up there , but it &apos;s one that people know .
and in a way , that is what makes it spiritual .
caliban : this island is mine .
and so i could play with the medium , and why i move from one medium to another is to be able to do this .
did you hear the lyrics ?
i think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well , so i moved to kenya and worked in uganda , and i met a group of rwandan women , who asked me , in 1986 , to move to kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there .
and at the end of it , we stood across the street and we looked at what we had done , and i said , &quot; it is so beautiful . &quot;
i want to tell you two stories . both of them are in africa .
so he moved back to the farm , and , long story short , they now have seven acres under cultivation .
and so , anuj and acumen have been talking about testing the private sector , because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that , look , in a country like tanzania , 80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day .
and my wish , when i see those women , i meet those farmers , and i think about all the people across this continent who are working hard every day , is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility , and that they also can believe and get access to services , so that their children , too , can live those lives of great purpose .
now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a rube goldberg machine is a complicated contraption , an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task .
and as if that wasn &apos;t enough , all of these incredibly complicating things , right , they wanted it in one shot .
and so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
we need some more ridiculous things besides &quot; the cabinet of natural curiosities . &quot;
as a matter of fact , this is by far the most important commission that leonardo has ever had , and for doing this great masterpiece , he was named the number one artist influence at the time .
and if you want to summarize in one just single word , well , this is what we &apos;re trying to do .
we induce cells , okay , say , skin cells , by adding a few genes to them , culturing them , and then harvesting them .
but that &apos;s not even all of it , because once a drug is approved , tissue engineering techniques can actually help us develop more personalized treatments .
and this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we , humans , are in charge of life on earth ; we &apos;re like the capricious gods of old greek myths , kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it .
we got a lot of people thinking about electric cars , what you could do with them . a few years later , when we suggested to gm that now is the time and we could do a thing called the impact , they sponsored it , and here &apos;s the impact that we developed with them on their programs . this is the demonstrator . and they put huge effort into turning it into a commercial product .
the friendly support , the quiet confidence , congenial hospitality shown by our hawaiian and military hosts -- this is starting -- made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable .
this one doesn &apos;t have the video in it , but you get a little feel from what it can do .
and if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be -- desirable , sustainable when your kids reach your age -- i think we actually can reach it . now , i said this was a warning , not a forecast . that was before -- i painted this before we started in on making robotic versions of hawk moths and cockroaches , and now i &apos;m beginning to wonder seriously -- was this more of a forecast than i wanted ?
on the field of battle , we are brave and noble warriors .
i explained it to all my friends . maths is beautiful .
- 1 = 31 .
lucas again , in 1876 , showed us - 1 , 21 digits long , was not prime .
put simply , in a room full of randomly selected people , i &apos;m a maths genius .
here &apos;s a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime .
it can take a randomly shuffled rubik &apos;s cube .
we thought it might be there , and we went and found it .
the disease was first sighted in the northeast of tasmania in 1996 and has spread across tasmania like a huge wave .
i myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when i was only 14 .
so how come a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual is growing on jonas &apos; face ?
and in fact , these same cells that are affecting kimbo here are also found affecting dogs in new york city , in mountain villages in the himalayas and in outback australia .
elizabeth murchison : fighting a contagious cancer
but private optimism about our own personal future remains persistent .
so some people say no .
well if you get the kiss now , it &apos;s over and done with .
if we expect the future to be bright , stress and anxiety are reduced .
but at the same time , when we hear that the housing market is hopeful , we think , &quot; oh , my house is definitely going to double in price . &quot;
then we interfered with the brain region that we found to integrate good news in this task , and the optimism bias disappeared .
because if you &apos;re one of these pessimistic penguins up there who just does not believe they can fly , you certainly never will .
now that &apos;s a big abstract number .
power is simple the ability to affect others to get the outcomes you want , and you can do it in three ways .
indeed , people were over-enthusiastic in the early 2000s , thinking america could do anything , which led us into some disastrous foreign policy adventures , and now we &apos;re back to decline again .
but you might ask , well so what in any case ?
top board : military power among states .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just zero sum , but positive sum .
and thirdly , what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers ?
and so now let me suggest two complimentary approaches to changing the reality of the situations .
elections produce a loser , who is then excluded .
jobs .
what might the bottlenecks be ?
so that &apos;s a way to get basic services scaled up .
gradually it would shift from a politics of plunder to a politics of hope . thank you .
that &apos;s the russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding arctic sea ice .
oxfam and swiss re , together with rockefeller foundation , are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water , but they &apos;re also providing for insurance when the droughts do come .
other examples to consider . in the u.k. , the thames barrier protects london from storm surge .
let &apos;s start with beatle mania : hysterical teenagers , crying , screaming , pandemonium .
why english ? in a single word : opportunity .
and now english is becoming the language of problem-solving .
and then they found , in 1898 , that they &apos;d put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute .
and he was interested , effectively , in what he could do with those concrete objects .
now , not only do we have much more education , and much of that education is scientific , and you can &apos;t do science without classifying the world .
compare the banker in 1900 , who really just needed a good accountant and to know who was trustworthy in the local community for paying back their mortgage .
in other words , they were fixed in the concrete mores and attitudes they had inherited .
the similarities subtest of the wechsler is about classification , and we have made enormous gains on that classification subtest .
you know , the spanish didn &apos;t sink the battleship maine , the lusitania was not an innocent vessel but was loaded with munitions , the north vietnamese did not attack the seventh fleet , and , of course , saddam hussein hated al qaeda and had nothing to do with it , and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people that they were brothers in arms , when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost .
and we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
her answer set the template for the entire career i was to have after that .
and i have that kind of flash sometimes .
we put all the problems of the world there , and i thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
there &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
but come to find out , a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team -- actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
i &apos;ll show you what my friend david says about this .
there was no way they could win .
every game we play is different .
many people were inspired by this .
you can just pull this out , this becomes a rectangle .
you can make a joint of four . you can make a joint of six .
and this is the other one -- that you just take a straw , and you just put a stick inside and you make two half-cuts .
now this is a pencil with a few slots over here .
this is a permanent magnet .
so no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound with wire vibrations .
there will be a spinning magnetic field .
and the second night , he would take the same cap and give it another fold .
and to make that , it involves extremes of temperature , extremes of pressure and loads of pollution .
and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes .
and i &apos;m just going to talk through this animation .
and during the evolution of life on the earth , it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy .
so it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land -- and in that sense , going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design .
and that builds up on the evaporators -- and that &apos;s what that image on the left is -- gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate .
and that &apos;s what we need to do , so let &apos;s be positive , and let &apos;s make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we &apos;ve ever seen .
i was looking for somebody who was jewish , because that &apos;s what i am and that was important to me .
so obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward .
and as it happens , the algorithms that were setting us up , they weren &apos;t bad either .
so once i had all this done , i then built a scoring system , because what i wanted to do was to sort of mathematically calculate whether or not i thought the guy that i found online would be a match with me .
i only wanted data on the women who were going to be attracted to the type of man that i really , really wanted to marry .
and as it turns out , i did a really good job .
they should be fluffy , not hard . &quot;
i &apos;d like to put this kind of friday night bar discussion aside and get you to actually step into the lab .
&#91; &quot; board &quot; &#93; audience : red.daphne bavelier : red .
so your typical normal young adult can have a span of about three or four objects of attention .
so we actually need to step into the lab and really measure what is the effect of each video game .
it doesn &apos;t really feel like playing mindless action video games .
well , i myself have spent the past 30 years of my life working on three large projects that really try to take the idea of computation seriously .
most of them do very simple things , but if you look along all these different pictures , at rule number 30 , you start to see something interesting going on .
and last year we were able to release the first website version of wolfram alpha .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas .
let me show you a couple of examples here .
well , it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing in the computational universe .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited to discover that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules that successfully reproduce special relativity , and even general relativity and gravitation , and at least give hints of quantum mechanics .
does your work relate to his ?
this was in the 90s during the peak of the hiv epidemic , before there were any arvs in sub-saharan africa .
these people are tall .
but when my father came , he would sell the cows , he would sell the products we had , and he went and drank with his friends in the bars .
it &apos;s a ceremony . people are enjoying it .
there is something about clothes , i think , and shoes .
&quot; well , dad , i need help . can you support me to go to america ? &quot;
and the reason they wanted the school for girls is because when a girl is raped when she &apos;s walking to school , the mother is blamed for that .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
and yet , at the same time , this very well may be a seminal moment in american history , an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america .
so consumers got overleveraged .
i &apos;ll give you some examples . lets talk about dentists , vasectomies , guns and shark attacks . okay ?
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary , sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases .
the consumer is demanding it .
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
it &apos;s now about connecting to your communities , connecting to your social networks .
and there is lots of really interesting examples here that we see .
so , when we look back and step out at this and see the beginning of these trends that we &apos;re seeing in our data , we see a very hopeful picture for the future of america .
why can i say , &quot; i &apos;ll take my steak medium rare , i need size six shoes , &quot; but i won &apos;t say , &quot; would you praise me this way ? &quot;
and i want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
now , i &apos;m aware that i should not be saying such things in front of an audience of scholars and scientists , but the truth is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions , i did not see anyone go back unhappy or unhealed .
i was an introverted child , to the point of communicating with colored crayons and apologizing to objects when i bumped into them , so my mother thought it might do me good to write down my day-to-day experiences and emotions .
i lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels .
but instead of settling down , i went to arizona .
when identity politics tries to put labels on us , it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger .
one is interested in sweeping generalizations .
like that , my fiction as well .
they connect all humanity , regardless of identity politics , and that is the good news .
last one , this is &quot; who &apos;s going to buy you ribbons , &quot; another traditional folk tune .
that &apos;s multi-touch , controlling a device by touching its display .
for example ...
thank you .
the second house ever built is house number two .
you see there , it &apos;s about 620 billion a year .
that &apos;s fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .
well , there is .
and so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only emit light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms .
there are a billion stars in the galactic core , which is why it &apos;s shining out so brightly .
this is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
on it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
and increasingly , the price we &apos;re being asked to pay for all of this connectedness is our privacy .
i then go to a news site , look for some headlines .
imagine in the physical world if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook and recorded their every movement .
but i turned around because i didn &apos;t recognize where my voice was coming from .
they &apos;re back in philadelphia .
it &apos;s only 500 miles .
but i use that story because they really wanted to help me .
but something happened -- exxon valdez .
how could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking make a difference ?
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a prisoner .
so , let &apos;s go out into the world and take this caring , this love , this respect that we &apos;ve shown each other right here at ted , and take this out into the world .
my daily life became very hard , but very simple .
i decided to cross during the day , first because i was still a kid and scared of the dark , second because i knew i was already taking a risk , and since not many people tried to cross during the day , i thought i might be able to cross without being seen by anyone .
when i looked down at my plate , i saw the last chicken wing , that my foster father had given me his .
this is my message to you .
thank you .
we stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
they &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , in the shelters built by the u.n. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
he said , &quot; as long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot;
mr. berlusconi brought g8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and i got half a million euros from the japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
long before sustainability became a buzzword , architect shigeru ban had begun his experiments with ecologically-sound building materials such as cardboard tubes and paper . his remarkable structures are often intended as temporary housing , designed to help the dispossessed in disaster-struck nations such as haiti , rwanda or japan . yet equally often the buildings remain a beloved part of the landscape long after they have served their intended purpose .
but the pregnant woman &apos;s own voice reverberates through her body , reaching the fetus much more readily .
the offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot-flavored cereal , and from the looks of it , they seemed to enjoy it more .
the opening of the nazi &apos;s siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades -- so cold the water in the canals froze solid .
the real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narrators , when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty .
thank you .
jean robert-houdin : a conjurer is not a juggler .
that makes my job more difficult , because , if i want to surprise them , i need to tell a story that starts the same , but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist .
this is my brother , jonny . he &apos;s 10 , and he plays the banjo .
quite nice in itself , they &apos;re little , sort of , airplane things .
so what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very , very large budget .
i said , &quot; when people login to their online bank there are lots and lots of things they &apos;d probably quite like to look at .
you know , there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money and you accomplish quite a lot .
late at night , after hours of practicing , i would listen to janis joplin and billie holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents &apos; stereo .
so what i &apos;m going to show you how to do is how to create one with a wii remote .
the stories we tell about each other matter very much .
i heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .
when i heard him speak , it was three years before that .
maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their guest and that made them feel proud .
we said , &quot; our little experiment has been a success .
the first one is , as i mentioned , entrepreneurship was a new idea to me .
that &apos;s around 130 billion dollars a year -- it &apos;s a lot .
and i think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try .
if we extrapolate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
the earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years .
indeed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .
when &apos;s the last time you really enjoyed just the voice of your friend ?
and i remember reading that book , and at 3 in the morning i was reading this book and it was explaining how the antennas i was using to measure the spins of galaxies could also be used to communicate , to send bits of information from one star system to another .
in fact , it &apos;s doubling every 18 months , and , of course , every card-carrying member of the digerati knows that that &apos;s moore &apos;s law .
well , at 9 : 30 in the morning , with my head down on my desk because i obviously hadn &apos;t slept all night , the phone rings and it &apos;s the new york times .
and they &apos;re just doing it because they want to explore , and you might say , &quot; oh , that &apos;s kind of a frivolous opportunity , &quot; but that &apos;s not frivolous . that &apos;s not a frivolous activity , because , i mean , think of ants .
and probably most of the people wouldn &apos;t even know the value of a swiss franc , okay ?
here i am at about 15 or something , doing that sort of stuff .
and i say that not because i am african , but it &apos;s in africa that you find the earliest evidence for human ancestors , upright walking traces , even the first technologies in the form of stone tools .
because it &apos;s only when you do that , that you can talk about -- -- it &apos;s only when you do that , &#91; that &#93; you can talk about how we looked like and how we behaved at different times , and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time .
you either don &apos;t know what you &apos;re looking for , or you &apos;re looking in the wrong place , &quot; he said .
so she belongs to our family tree , but within that , of course , you do detailed analysis , and we know now that she belongs to the lucy species , known as australopithecus afarensis .
but that care means also you learn .
of course , in addition to extracting this huge amount of scientific information as to what makes us human , you know , the many human ancestors that have existed over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 -- they did not have the knowledge , the technology and sophistications that we , homo sapiens , have today .
instead , they just make me green with envy that my colleague from iucn was able to go on this journey to the south of madagascar seamounts to actually take photographs and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep .
that is , we &apos;re able to save it from a fate of deep-sea bottom trawling .
so anything in the water is treated as if it &apos;s the high seas .
we need to work locally , but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide .
but we need to think broad-scale . we need to think globally .
so here we are , seven years , 500 interviews later , and i &apos;m gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes ted-sters tick .
now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires .
right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to youtube every single minute .
well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
and archie cochrane , as the camp doctor , was one of the first men in to clear up the mess .
and the next morning , supplies of vitamin b12 are delivered to the camp , and the prisoners begin to recover .
this is produced by the physicist cesar hidalgo .
so this is the complexity of the world that surrounds us .
well you have this great big tank full of liquid detergent .
we have no idea why it works , no idea at all .
and there &apos;s an authority figure in the corner behind the teacher &apos;s desk who knows all the answers .
and after the trial had been running for a little while , he gathered together all his colleagues around his table , and he said , &quot; well , gentlemen , we have some preliminary results .
it isn &apos;t easy .
there are many science-based analyses of this , but they all draw the same conclusion -- that we &apos;re living beyond our means .
there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things .
and that &apos;s what will happen to us .
but we see , mistakenly , each of these issues as individual problems to be solved .
maybe fear .
i wanted to know what that would take , so i worked with professor jorgen randers from norway to find the answer .
well it &apos;s time to grow up , to be wiser , to be calmer , like generations before us , we &apos;ll be growing up in war -- not a war between civilizations , but a war for civilization , for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle age .
it turns out that b of a in september had 32 times .
and then all bets are off .
we &apos;ve got to quit borrowing as much , because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie .
and let me recap some of the stuff you &apos;ve seen .
they tried to engineer bacterias in such a way that they would act as your kidneys .
i mean , you understand where this story &apos;s going .
you &apos;ve also got flies , the size of flies , that are being made by robert wood at harvard .
it is a natural state in everything that is alive , including hominids .
but the worst thing about it was that you couldn &apos;t use it on the youngest children , on infants , and on one-year-olds .
and the parents were very unhappy , and they said , &quot; this is a terrible thing , because how can the cheap and easy thing be as good as the hard thing ? &quot; and the government was very upset .
and that &apos;s that middle set of bars .
and it turns out that as we called around to the independent crash test companies around the country , none of them wanted to do our crash test because they said , some explicitly , some not so explicitly , &quot; all of our business comes from car seat manufacturers .
anyway , it turns out that those two crashes , that actually the three-year-old did slightly worse . so , he gets about a 500 out of -- you know , on this range -- relative to a 400 and something .
you &apos;ve got a regular seat for adults , and then you fold it down , and the kid sits on top , and it &apos;s integrated .
in the new jersey data , which is different , because it &apos;s not just fatal crashes , but all crashes in new jersey that are reported , it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries , but generally they &apos;re the minor injuries .
it &apos;s impossible in theory , but possible in practice .
that &apos;s a lot of storage , memory . nine exabyte ram .
and so in some ways , all you really need is a cloudbook .
and so one of the consequences of that , i believe , is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now -- tv , film , video -- that basically becomes one media platform .
so you were forwarding on . you didn &apos;t have control .
there &apos;s like a billion social sites on the web .
and we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot;
we &apos;ll have a better word for it .
i started going out on cases .
the thing i had to admit to myself , with great repulsion , was that i get it .
but it &apos;s a human problem . it &apos;s a scientific problem , if you will .
and those things are the reflection of the processes , and the time that they are made .
this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very , very large city project that came directly out of this process , which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it .
and this was the first prototype in korea , as we &apos;re dealing with a dynamic envelope , and then the same characteristic of the fabric .
and now it turned into something much , much broader as a problem , and it has to do with performance .
there it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work .
and a project that was realized in austria , the hooper bank , which again used this idea of connecting typology , the traditional buildings , and morphology , or the relationship of the development of land as an idea , into a complex , which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting , this movement of the land that &apos;s a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it , and other parts are much more energetic and intense .
you &apos;ll find a stair that &apos;s the same length as the supreme court .
so i would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves .
we populated all the ecologies .
but of course , they are hard-wired but we use them still in a sophisticated way .
this is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing and you digest , which is actually the lumen .
at least in my case , they are not listened to .
so our research -- and i think the research also at the universities -- are now fixing on these points to say : how can we actually -- and this might sound trivial now to you -- how can we change cooking ?
we all have to deal with the mystery of death , the world that waits beyond death , the elders who fall away into their elderly years .
i travelled for a month in nepal with our good friend , matthieu ricard , and you &apos;ll remember matthieu famously said to all of us here once at ted , &quot; western science is a major response to minor needs . &quot;
and for one day , he wears the clothing of his sister and he becomes a transvestite , a waylaka . and for that day , he leads all able-bodied men on a run , but it &apos;s not your ordinary run .
and where does the river rise ?
the other side is planted like that by the men . metaphorically , you turn it on the side , and you have a piece of cloth .
and we ran into a farc patrol at dawn , so it was quite harrowing .
our industrial society is scarcely 300 years old .
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year , in everything from building materials to surfboards to coffee cups to table tops .
when a tree &apos;s done using its leaves -- its solar collectors , these amazing molecular photon capturing devices -- at the end of a season , it doesn &apos;t pack them up , take them to the leaf reprocessing center and have them melted down to form new leaves .
this gives us a continuous stream of material that we can put into almost any shape , though today we &apos;re making corner blocks .
the next is self-assembly , because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process .
the control of a laser is so precise that you can perform surgery inside of an eye , you can use it to store massive amounts of data , and you can use it for this beautiful experiment that my friend was struggling to explain .
now , the idea is not as crazy as it sounds .
it distracts them with pretty pictures , irrelevant data .
but unlike the other speakers , i &apos;m not going to tell you about the mysteries of the universe , or the wonders of evolution , or the really clever , innovative ways people are attacking the major inequalities in our world .
she told this to one of her colleagues , who said , &quot; well , what does your boyfriend do ? &quot;
the next time , after the 15th toss .
if you went head-tail-head-tail-head , you can cunningly get two occurrences of the pattern in only five tosses .
it &apos;s a very , very simple example , an easily stated question in probability , which every -- you &apos;re in good company -- everybody gets wrong .
to try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases .
amongst these million individuals , most of them are healthy and some of them will have the disease .
and just to set it in context , you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child , and then two , if they &apos;re innocent , to be convicted of murdering them .
and the other one was the chance , a priori , that the person had the disease or not .
it &apos;s very well documented that people get things wrong .
in other spheres of life , if people argued -- well , except possibly for politics -- but in other spheres of life , if people argued illogically , we &apos;d say that &apos;s not a good thing .
so here is what we did . we put a 10-cent digital transponder , a data tag , in the appliance plug .
and also , i talked to friends about china and chinese internet .
but sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple .
he allowed facebook , a u.s.-based service , to continue to stay on inside of tunisia .
but in english it &apos;s 20 words or a sentence with a short link .
but now we have weibo , so i call it the weibo petition .
they have everything in their hands .
but this technology is very new , but technically is very old .
now when we think of our senses , we don &apos;t usually think of the reasons why they probably evolved , from a biological perspective .
she &apos;s in a very supportive environment .
this is her 10 years later .
in fact , most implant users really struggle and dislike music because it sounds so bad .
you distort it a little bit , especially in terms of pitch , and you &apos;ve changed it .
i had patients tell me that those sound the same .
and this is of a student of mine named joseph who i had the good fortune to work with for three years in my lab .
and we have a much longer way to go when it comes to the idea of restoring perfect hearing .
i did not choose to take up the pen , the brush , the camera .
and i want to tell you how this gun can help .
then in high school , i was gripped by the stories of the allied soldiers -- soldiers who left the safety of their own homes and risked their lives to liberate a country and a people that they didn &apos;t know .
such a state monopoly on violence , first of all , serves as a reassurance .
every day i hope that politicians , diplomats , development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope .
so that &apos;s great . so that was too easy .
i mix them together , add a little bit of salt water , and then add this long strand i was telling you about , that i &apos;ve stolen from a virus . and then what happens is , you heat this whole thing up to about boiling . you cool it down to room temperature , and as you do , what happens is those short strands , they do the following thing : each one of them binds that long strand in one place , and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place , and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together .
friction climbing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive edges .
rule number five : know how to rest .
i &apos;ve been quite interested in both .
but if you ask me , what will it cost for one mips of computing in 2010 , or the cost to sequence a base pair of dna in 2012 , or the cost of sending a megabyte of data wirelessly in 2014 , it turns out that those are very predictable .
and then evolution used those body plans to evolve higher cognitive functions , and biological evolution kept accelerating .
whole different paradigm -- transistors came out of the woodwork .
in terms of price performance , that &apos;s a 40 to 50 percent deflation rate .
there are exciting new forms of gene therapy that overcome the problem of placing the genetic material in the right place on the chromosome .
you could sit at the bottom of your pool for four hours -- so , &quot; honey , i &apos;m in the pool , &quot; will take on a whole new meaning .
wall street noticed that this was a revolutionary technology , which it was , but then six months later , when it hadn &apos;t revolutionized all business models , they figured , well , that was wrong , and then we had this bust .
but most importantly , it &apos;ll be a tremendous expansion of human intelligence through this direct merger with our technology , which in some sense we &apos;re doing already .
this device , the ade 651 , was sold to the iraqi government for 40,000 dollars apiece .
our second type of error is a false negative .
or is it more like a frog ?
there actually is something here , but it &apos;s degraded .
dopamine , i think , changes our signal-to-noise ratio .
and you see the lamp here , i know .
but anyway , the point is still made .
the intelligent designer &apos;s always portrayed as this super intelligent , moral being that comes down to design life .
our agenticity process comes from the fact that we can enjoy movies like these .
now , what i &apos;m going to be looking for in this test is how it protects your lips , the texture , right , and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not .
so , witness was started in &apos; 92 and it &apos;s since given cameras out in over 60 countries .
i fell . they ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead .
there could be a new movement growing up , rising from the ground , reaching for the light , and growing strong , just like a tree . thank you .
the first is how it deals with this obstacle that we &apos;ve put in its way . see , look , it does a little dance , and then it carries on in exactly the same direction that it took in the first place .
that was what was of interest to us next .
it isn &apos;t climbing . it isn &apos;t dancing , because its body temperature is actually relatively low .
on the way home , he knows where home is , and he wants to go straight to it .
we don &apos;t know yet what dung beetles use .
actually , a lot of things are better with fire in my world , but the fire &apos;s just a foundation .
i &apos;m going to wave through the kinect here and take control , and now i &apos;m going to reach out and i &apos;m going to touch a star , and when i do , it will play the sentence that generated that star .
designer jared ficklin creates wild visualizations that let us see music , using color and even fire to analyze how sound makes us feel . he takes a brief digression to analyze the sound of a skatepark -- and how audio can clue us in to developing creativity .
mallory &apos;s argument that leaving the house , embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t tally that neatly with my own experience .
this is a photo of captain scott and his team .
good morning . my name is david rose .
you &apos;ve got to convey passion .
there are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company .
it starts off , you walk in the door .
you want to tie in to the rest of the world out there .
bill gates &apos; powerpoint presentation over here .
and you &apos;re focused on me and why i &apos;m such a great guy , and why you want to invest in me .
no , never do a live demo .
but then comes the ask .
if you use apple &apos;s keynote , it &apos;s got an even better version in keynote .
i went to an online encyclopedia , wikipedia , and i entered the term &quot; earth . &quot;
chimborazo !
yeah .
pan troglodytes , the name we give him , means &quot; cave dweller . &quot;
what this means is that if you could shrink the earth to the size of a billiard ball , if you could take planet earth , with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests , astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees , voodoo dolls , fireflies , chocolate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball , it would be as smooth as a billiard ball , presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle .
where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd ?
in case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
step two : we get the baby . woohoo !
autocratic -- do what i say because i &apos;m the chef .
rats play , but what you might not have known is that rats that play more have bigger brains and they learn tasks better , skills .
we &apos;re designed to do that continuously -- to play and play a lot and not stop playing .
we have this concept that the opposite of play is work .
what happens ? they give better service -- not worse , but better .
well we did win , every year that we entered , one of the rankings for best employer for small business .
you know what , let them use their mobile phone for personal calls -- heaven forbid .
so i understand that this meeting was planned , and the slogan was from was to still .
well , to describe our profession otherwise , we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty .
first i set up a shop in my own garden , and made pottery which i sold on the marketplace in budapest .
this was my first job .
my archive : 175 films , my 16-millimeter negative , all my books , my dad &apos;s books , my photographs .
that &apos;s my daughter , jean .
my children , davey and henry .
and we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting .
the baby was coming , and i was ready for this mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet .
av : yes , and i often joke with rufus when he comes home that i &apos;m not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies .
so alisa &apos;s experience is not isolated .
there &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
and so we all remember as children , the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children -- the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation , and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair .
and so the final question that we would ask is : can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards ?
but the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers , and what instruments they were using .
how about that ?
here &apos;s now something we know in spectacular quality .
it says right now , we think music is notes and how they &apos;re played .
and on the sweet spot on the stage , tatum starts playing ...
i &apos;ve got a very confused background which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times .
and i think one of the lessons of history is that even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity .
like the mayor of são paulo who &apos;s banned advertising billboards , or the many cities like san francisco putting in infrastructures for electric cars .
now , what he did didn &apos;t used to have a name , but i think it &apos;s rapidly becoming quite mainstream .
it will become more involved in social investment , and social care and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others , not just from what you sell to them , and from relationships as well as from consumption .
geoff mulgan : post-crash , investing in a better world
if we were speaking mandarin chinese with each other , though , i wouldn &apos;t have that luxury .
you speak english , a futured language .
so for example , there is the survey of health , &#91; aging &#93; and retirement in europe .
yes , futureless language speakers , even after this level of control , are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year .
well actually , i hope for a while longer yet .
okay .
so the books are in english , the journals are done in english , but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy .
so immediately , we &apos;re rejecting them .
and anyway , there was never enough kerosene , because what does a dollar a day buy for you ?
but that began thinking about how birds went around , and then how airplanes would , how hang gliders would fly , and then other planes , and the idea of the gossamer-condor-type airplane quickly emerged , was so logical , one should have thought of it in the first place , but one didn &apos;t . and it was just , keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up , like a hang glider , but three times the span , three times the cord .
the green line goes down . that &apos;s the wild nature portion .
we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future , and we produced products for the company .
let &apos;s have the next video .
and this , we just wanted to show you -- if we can get the video running on this , yeah -- just an example of a little video surveillance .
and asanga lived 800 years after the buddha &apos;s time .
and he again leaves , and this time : water dripping , making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream .
so he says , &quot; well , i &apos;ll put my tongue on the dog &apos;s flesh .
maitreya then took him to a certain heaven , which is the typical way a buddhist myth unfolds .
so , we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love -- just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don &apos;t know .
you will even weep , perhaps , with gratitude and kindness .
and then you realize they don &apos;t even have compassion on themselves .
in the great teaching of his holiness the dalai lama that he always teaches everywhere , he says that that is the common religion of humanity : kindness .
so , what is simplicity ?
one answer would be : because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high and they bounce against things rapidly -- that &apos;s a kind of physical science argument .
these are cars and drivers . they dissipate energy .
the internet starts with mathematics , it starts with binary .
in boston ... boston is a little bit like namibia in its cell phone coverage , so that we &apos;re not accustomed to that all the time , but some of the time .
but if you have something that has a function , and it &apos;s really cheap , people will find new ways of putting it together to make new things .
and i think that &apos;s a very good way of thinking about the problem .
all right . well , thank you so much for your talk . thank you .
they can say &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; to the invention .
if you want to find the big new ideas , it &apos;s often difficult to find them in mainstream markets , in big organizations .
this has huge organizational implications for very large areas of life .
that is why the competition with microsoft is bound to come -- will only come -- from an open-source kind of project .
what &apos;s the role of the bbc , for instance , in that world ?
if , for some reason , your credit card bounces , or there &apos;s some other problem , you lose your character .
and the way that i &apos;ve been doing it has been multifaceted .
ze frank : so -- yeah .
it &apos;s been an interesting two weeks . &quot;
i guess the shoes came off when he was hit .
&quot; i voted blue . i voted red .
so the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter &apos;s room at some point , and she actually was singing that song to herself .
hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine so i asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities , just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on , so i could just get their voices back .
and what came up was a number of pieces of data .
theoretically what this means is that in order to express this gene , in a violent way , very early on , before puberty , you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic -- not a little stress , not being spanked or something , but really seeing violence , or being involved in it , in 3d .
and that book is very interesting . because it &apos;s about witch trials , and how people thought back then .
over 10,000 physicists and engineers from 85 countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine .
absolutely everything .
just up the road .
i &apos;ll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
they &apos;re surrounded by people , and their passage through the room is impeded .
many other things that the lhc could discover .
absolutely remarkable .
another aha ! moment came from a 2010 wayne state university research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of major league players .
please , don &apos;t try this at home .
when we painted the first building , by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade , something unimaginable happened .
people started to drop less litter in the streets , for example , started to pay taxes , started to feel something they had forgotten , and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police , or the state itself , were missing .
we could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks , every week , but we could not change this corrupt practice .
it is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
but haiti provided us with something else unprecedented .
but does it work ?
they &apos;re showing us what can be done with mobile , digital technologies .
and convert it to humanitarian good .
i &apos;m a novelist , and i &apos;m interested in the self because the self and fiction have a lot in common .
we need time &apos;s arrow to understand cause and effect , not just in the material world , but in our own intentions and our motivations .
and therein lies its greatest convenience and horror .
it cannot be stored .
my search is always to find ways to chronicle , to share and to document stories about people , just everyday people .
and then we went to a fish restaurant , and we had chad , the surfer dude , serving us , and he came up and my mother said , &quot; do you have any specials , young man ? &quot;
and she told this woman .
which sort of made me feel good , because he &apos;d seen a lot of things .
i &apos;m sure he thought i &apos;d take a book or a shirt , but i found an inflatable sheep .
the igbo used to say that they built their own gods .
chris abani tells stories of people : people standing up to soldiers . people being compassionate . people being human and reclaiming their humanity . it &apos;s &quot; ubuntu , &quot; he says : the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect my humanity back at me .
so almost all life on earth is wiped out about five times .
well svante paabo has the answer .
why would that matter ?
and what those four chemicals do is they take any cell and take it way back up the mountain so it can become any body part .
well let &apos;s take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand .
other people react with various psychological conditions or reactions to this information .
so this weighs a little more than a tenth of a pound .
so this should be clear in these videos .
and that four-dimensional space consists of x , y , z and then the yaw angle .
and so here we looked to nature .
and to fly through obstacles they can adapt the formations on the fly .
so i want to show you a clip of algorithms developed by frank shen and professor nathan michael that shows this robot entering a building for the very first time and creating this map on the fly .
in his lab at penn , vijay kumar and his team build flying quadrotors , small , agile robots that swarm , sense each other , and form ad hoc teams -- for construction , surveying disasters and far more .
so we know flowers , we know fruits and vegetables , even some alfalfa in hay that the livestock for the meats that we eat , rely on pollinators , but you &apos;ve got male and female parts to a plant here , and basically pollinators are attracted to plants for their nectar , and in the process , a bee will visit some flowers and pick up some pollen , or that male kind of sperm counterpart , along the way , and then travel to different flowers , and eventually an apple , in this case , will be produced .
why are bees doing better in the city ?
i &apos;m not one of the many researchers around the world who &apos;s looking at the effects of pesticides or diseases or habitat loss and poor nutrition on bees .
i mean , locally in boston , there is a terrific company called green city growers , and they are going and pollinating their squash crops by hand with q-tips , and if they miss that three day window , there &apos;s no fruit .
but i do want to talk to you about something that i think is dear to all of us .
why do we have this image ?
and that is a feat that we are not really conscious of that much .
wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticated and the most important crop we still grow today .
let &apos;s go back to small-scale , to farmers &apos; markets , small bakeries and all that . &quot; wonderful .
and i &apos;m making a real plea here .
there are also robots , for example , who can recognize weeds with a resolution of half an inch .
talk to farmers . when was the last time you went to a farm and talked to a farmer ?
i want you to think that every bite connects you to the past and the future : to these anonymous farmers , that first bred the first wheat varieties ; and to the farmers of today , who &apos;ve been making this . and you don &apos;t even know who they are .
how do you make a mountain bike for your arms that doesn &apos;t have the mountain bike cost and complexity ?
so we teamed up with continuum , a local product design firm here in boston to make the high-end version , the developed world version , that we &apos;ll probably sell primarily in the u.s. and europe , but to higher-income buyers .
and i know we &apos;ve all seen images enough to make us numb , of the tragedies that we &apos;re perpetrating on the planet .
you can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we &apos;re there .
it &apos;s just a wresting match , but a remarkable activity .
it has remarkable features .
people scoop water out of the chambal and drink it , something you wouldn &apos;t do in most north indian rivers .
so , we &apos;re not sure where this story is going to end , whether it &apos;s got a happy or sad ending .
do you have those conversations with people ?
and so , really , so much of what we do in medicine and life in general is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet .
this is not unusual , and it &apos;s part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes , because it makes such a big difference in their quality of life .
or they eat when they get depressed , or they use alcohol to numb the pain , or they work too hard , or watch too much tv .
two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese , and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years . it &apos;s no joke : it &apos;s real .
and the fiber fills you up before you get too many calories , and it slows the absorption so you don &apos;t get that rapid rise in blood sugar .
so when you go on these kinds of diet , they begin to smell bad .
it can be sexual intimacy – i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .
so i want to show you a clip of the film now .
we &apos;ve created a completely digital human head .
he needed to be a very sympathetic character .
and of course , the first step is : admit you &apos;ve got a problem .
that &apos;s not terribly compelling .
so , effectively , you get 3d data in real time of the subject .
so , in fact , anatomically , it is correct .
from there we went into a process called image analysis .
we also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words .
ed ulbrich , the digital-effects guru from digital domain , explains the oscar-winning technology that allowed his team to digitally create the older versions of brad pitt &apos;s face for &quot; the curious case of benjamin button . &quot;
and they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle .
and this is what we turn them into .
the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world .
and they started slashing away at the back of the camels , and they started galloping .
hello . this is keith bellows with the national geographic camel investigation unit .
you can &apos;t really see too clear . the fur &apos;s kind of grown over .
well -- and you &apos;re glad i didn &apos;t show you this .
amazingly full lips that allow me to eat practically anything that grows .
no surprise .
attempts to put my poems to music have had disastrous results , in all cases .
one of my students came up after class , an introductory class , and she said , &quot; you know , poetry is harder than writing , &quot; which i found both erroneous and profound .
no wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
the dead are always looking down on us , they say .
by the way , i lied about schubert doing the dishes , but that doesn &apos;t mean he never helped out around the house . &quot;
that doesn &apos;t make any sense .
and of course , there &apos;s food on the box .
otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears .
if you talk with a sad person , you &apos;re going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture , and before you know it you feel sad .
actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed , and then they see what young children do .
so the one who makes the choices always gets a reward .
so that &apos;s the experiment we did .
and i think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile .
now , here come two more people , and immediately after , three more people .
and this was an amazing year .
i was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .
so that was nice .
and they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in europe because of noise pollution .
i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make .
would i be willing to provide a scientific endorsement of a mood-boosting bottled water ?
so the first unproven claim is that you can use brain scans to read people &apos;s thoughts and emotions .
and in some cases , oxytocin can even decrease cooperation .
thank you .
we don &apos;t know .
and the proponents of this theory point to that small pocket of dravidian-speaking people in the north , actually near afghanistan , and they say that perhaps , sometime in the past , dravidian languages were spoken all over india and that this suggests that the indus civilization is perhaps also dravidian .
okay . left to right ?
so imagine a monkey sitting at a keyboard .
why is that the case ?
in dravidian languages , the word for fish is &quot; meen &quot; which happens to sound just like the word for star .
space , we all know what it looks like .
the line carried the telephone signals that would later make bell a household name .
jansky had made a historic discovery , that celestial objects could emit radio waves as well as light waves .
thank you .
we do enjoy our misery in a certain way .
but apparently , this is a strange paradox of life .
it should be done by fun . generosity is more fun . that &apos;s the key .
and you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that chiho showed us .
he said , &quot; no , i want to abolish the poor . &quot;
150 years ago i suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
one of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations .
it said &quot; david , age 10 . &quot;
the translation of that is , could you help me build a foot ?
if you want to study how a foot works , we &apos;re going to have to simulate those surfaces , or simulate that debris .
it walks on two legs and it holds the other arms up in the air so that it can &apos;t be seen .
robert full : it &apos;s spiny , right ? it &apos;s really spiny , isn &apos;t it ? it sort of hurts .
watch the leg come around , and you &apos;ll see it grab on right there .
and here &apos;s the simple version of a foot for a new robot that i &apos;ll show you in a bit .
they can run up a surface at a meter per second , take 30 steps in that one second -- you can hardly see them .
so we &apos;ve redefined , now , what a foot is .
and so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sped up 20 times -- can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor ? ok ?
so the large baleen whales will produce long , beautiful songs , which are used in reproductive advertisement for male and females , both to find one another and to select a mate .
so when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters , less than half the time they need to use whistles .
so it could have a negative impact on the whole population .
it had deep underwater microphones , or hydrophones , cabled to shore , all wired back to a central place that could listen to sounds over the whole north atlantic .
that &apos;s shown down here .
it &apos;s louder than noise at a range of a thousand kilometers .
and i &apos;m happy to say that there are several very promising developments in this area , looking at the impact of shipping on whales .
but then they often wait there .
of course , we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy .
so , what you &apos;re seeing here is a wonderful presentation , but it &apos;s one of the tours .
what &apos;s the evidence of wiping out ?
and the problem is the industry is supplying it .
again , i can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around .
i &apos;m a little more interested in the kind of creative applications we can do with this .
don &apos;t worry .
what if none of these things is the problem ?
so streets become more desolate and unsafe , so we stay home more -- which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe , and we stay home even more .
seven days later , eric was set free and was able to return home .
what are we going to do ?
and he had a real passion for golf , and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and various things .
juggling three balls is simple and normal .
it &apos;s being able to do something that other people can &apos;t do or can &apos;t understand .
you want to do it ? yeah ? ok .
so white ball and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . pink .
all right , i &apos;m going to get on my knees and do it .
to have a conversation with it . to speak . to listen .
the next piece that i &apos;m going to do -- which is the cylinders piece , if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago , which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs . i love ceramics and all of that .
and to change , and to change .
and i think you &apos;re starting to see that , and it &apos;s making our job even more enjoyable .
so you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around , as you look .
s so far it &apos;s chaos , but a lot of people are doing stuff , so that &apos;s good .
you could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater -- of feeling like you &apos;re underwater -- seeing what &apos;s going on .
well , it &apos;s always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers .
it &apos;s about an m.p. called geoffrey dickens .
isn &apos;t that incredible that we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds ?
the universe disappears .
gas was invented in 1600 by a dutch chemist called van helmont .
and that &apos;s what they do , radio . that &apos;s what they discovered .
jean-baptiste michel : so how did we get to this conclusion ?
what we &apos;re left with is a collection of five million books , 500 billion words , a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome -- a text which , when written out , would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over -- a veritable shard of our cultural genome .
alternatively , i could say , &quot; yesterday , i thrived . &quot;
people were walking around obsessed .
and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person .
it &apos;s kind of like genomics .
and it turns out that the less-frequent &quot; arghs &quot; are , of course , the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating -- except , oddly , in the early 80s .
and then there is a whole range of filters .
we &apos;re becoming impatient .
where are they ? where are those ripples ?
if you &apos;re in any one of those roles -- and i think that probably is everybody who &apos;s listening to this talk -- the acronym is rasa , which is the sanskrit word for juice or essence .
and i would get harassed sometimes .
and that night , her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds .
well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
but it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s not easy to ask .
what if we started asking , &quot; how do we let people pay for music ? &quot;
when i launched my wish last year , hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us .
do you know what it takes to do this ?
but maybe we should change the question .
but i don &apos;t remember exactly how it happened , but i have one recollection , which was pretty strong in my mind .
i was very depressed . i said , but i can make a difference in this field .
and so the theorist guys say , well , i think this is what &apos;s going on , and the experimentalist says , no , you &apos;re wrong .
but , you know what ? it &apos;s very , very regular .
and now it &apos;s not that hard , you know , here &apos;s the apple , here &apos;s the orange , you know , the earth goes around , that kind of stuff .
real intelligence is built on something else .
and it doesn &apos;t fit , so it gets all wrinkly . now look at how i &apos;ve drawn this here .
and these things happen all the time . you &apos;re making these predictions .
we test it by prediction . what is the next word in this , you know ?
you cannot learn or recall anything outside of a sequence .
i don &apos;t know how this is going to turn out .
we need to redefine what makes us secure in this world .
he said , &quot; you know that i kind of like meditation , and i pray . &quot;
and instead of going home , she conferred with all the other women that she works with , who said to her , &quot; stay out . we need you out .
she also received the peace prize .
my mother carefully opened the door , and she loaded the laundry into the machine , like this .
because it remains hard work for women to wash .
and these ones who have washing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
and she also got books for herself .
we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study , and we took a shot with a webcam , and we asked them to fill out a survey on a laptop .
now you may be thinking , this does not apply to me , because i have nothing to hide .
transparency can be misdirected .
of course , these technologies imply a shifting of cost and revenues between data holders and data subjects , which is why , perhaps , you don &apos;t hear more about them .
alessandro acquisti : why privacy matters
we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn &apos;t do anything stupid .
in one of my books , i joke that ben &amp; amp ; jerry &apos;s should make a pacifist toothpaste -- doesn &apos;t kill germs , just asks them to leave .
and so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute , of which it can be consciously aware of about 40 .
we emerge out of relationships , and we are deeply interpenetrated , one with another .
twenty percent of kids do not have those relationships .
the third is what you might call sympathy , the ability to work within groups .
and all at once i found myself saying as tears flowed , &apos; that &apos;s me . that &apos;s me . &apos; and those simple words brought back many thoughts that i had had before , about the fusion of our souls into one higher-level entity , about the fact that at the core of both our souls lay our identical hopes and dreams for our children , about the notion that those hopes were not separate or distinct hopes , but were just one hope , one clear thing that defined us both , that welded us into a unit -- the kind of unit i had but dimly imagined before being married and having children .
anjali &apos;s father , a drunkard , sold his child for pornography .
these people are deceived , forced .
when i rescued them , one of the biggest challenges i had was where do i begin .
my biggest challenge is society .
can you break your culture of silence ?
and those bits are words .
so , there &apos;s this guy , right ? victorian era .
very useful word . so , look at that .
so , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
and so people say to me , &quot; how do i know if a word is real ? &quot;
one of them is just labeled &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
he &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
they use it synecdochically .
i think that i may have believed unconsciously , then , that i was kind of a business hero .
this has been a big , big transition time , and i believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever &apos;s next .
and so , gradually over these three days , you start off kind of trying to figure out , &quot; why am i listening to all this irrelevant stuff ? &quot;
they may well be by a ted speaker , and so we can get the conversation going during the year and come back next year having had the same intellectual , emotional journey .
for some time now , it &apos;s been known that if you pay attention to the carrier phase of the gps signal , and if you have an internet connection , then you can go from meter level to centimeter level , even millimeter-level positioning .
every time her ex-boyfriend would show up , at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations , he was carrying an open laptop , and over time carol realized that he had planted a gps tracking device on her car , so she was calling me for help to disable it .
they -- in fact , they don &apos;t update or upkeep lighthouses anymore , and loran , the only backup to gps , was discontinued last year .
here &apos;s ramon — — looking for a little attention from dad that week .
but will you be able to resist the temptation to track your fellow man ?
and of course , the object had to be very grand and have a sense of ritualism , the way my uncle likes it .
and on the left side , you &apos;ll see the processed video where the camera has made him invisible .
but he doesn &apos;t need to , because it manages to lift itself up on its own .
a classic example is james hansen , a nasa climatologist pushing for 350 parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
so when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime of these various energy sources , nuclear is down there with wind and hydro , below solar and way below , obviously , all the fossil fuels .
typically , these things are put in the ground .
if we look at the delays , it takes between 10 and 19 years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation .
actually , the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world .
we want to match the hour-by-hour power supply .
pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is , and we can move toward zero weapons left , once we know all that .
the propaganda from the industry has been very , very strong .
the last person who was in favor made the premise that we don &apos;t have enough alternative renewable resources .
and you can match that demand , hour-by-hour , for the whole year almost .
you know , it &apos;s the first time that we &apos;re going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy , a chance to , if you would , back up the biosphere .
and we knew nothing about going to space .
but how cheap could it get ? i want to give you the end point .
and of course , we had beautiful spaceshipone , which made those two flights and won the competition .
and then i truly believe , once a group is in orbit around the earth -- i know if they don &apos;t do it , i am -- we &apos;re going to stockpile some fuel , make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate .
that &apos;s our value proposition in a prize .
would they surprise us ? would they intrigue us ?
so that means that surfaces can intersect themselves , they can become impossibly small .
a challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column .
unbeknownst to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the column , which was quite a surprising discovery .
inspired by cell division , michael hansmeyer writes algorithms that design outrageously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of facets . no person could draft them by hand , but they &apos;re buildable -- and they could revolutionize the way we think of architectural form .
well , what is it to make a therapeutic , anyway ?
how do we go faster ?
francis collins : so what would you like to say to researchers here in the auditorium and others listening to this ?
it just started last december , and this is one of its goals .
and third , and maybe most important , we need talent .
we know that modernization is happening .
you might be surprised to know that most people in the gulf who are leading these cultural initiatives happen to be women .
our mission is of cultural integration and independence .
girl : uncle khaled . here , put on the headscarf .
i welcome you on board for us to engage and discuss new ideas of how to bring people together through cultural initiatives and discussions .
so i was hiding in the shed , like that .
and then i encouraged the ants to come &apos; round by putting sugar and things like that .
and underneath the microscope there were splinters of glass .
and as i was doing it , what happened ?
there &apos;s not enough room for the two of them .
decided to make a paintbrush .
in america they say a period stop .
that one took me approximately six weeks .
so the eyes are probably about one micron or something .
and the prophet , in one of his sayings , said , &quot; adorn yourselves with the attributes of god . &quot;
&quot; and , &quot; god says , &quot; my servant continues to get nearer to me , by doing more of what i &apos;ve asked them to do &quot; -- extra credit , we might call it -- &quot; until i love him or love her .
the language differs , but the objective is the same .
and this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals .
i have cancer .
my wife , as i said , she grew up outside of boston .
linda , my wife , joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals .
&quot; so it &apos;s 10 years from now , &quot; i said , &quot; and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad , and i &apos;m not here .
and one night i had a nightmare that i was walking through my house , sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else &apos;s children sitting on my desk .
one day , my daughter tybee , tybee came to me , and she said , &quot; i have so much love for you in my body , daddy , i can &apos;t stop giving you hugs and kisses .
and he said , &quot; a belief in themselves . &quot;
and i just love this ode to slow moving .
and all the collective minds in this room , i dare say , can never find a solution for scan-xiety .
now nanny &apos;s great other insight was to think , perhaps we should get derek something to play , and sure enough , she dragged this little keyboard out of the loft , never thinking really that anything much would come of it .
now then , by the age of 10 , derek really had taken the world by storm .
dp : this .
ao : well done .
dp : &quot; tiger rag . &quot;
this is affordable and can come home with you and , as such , it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can &apos;t go in your drawers ; trust me , i found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design .
i just explained design .
and so , i want to give you a greeting , as from a chimpanzee in the forests of tanzania -- ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh !
it was , fortunately , one adult male whom i &apos;d named david greybeard -- and by the way , science at that time was telling me that i shouldn &apos;t name the chimps ; they should all have numbers ; that was more scientific .
they know mental as well as physical suffering .
were the people that we heard about yesterday , on the easter island , who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid ?
they were feeling despair , they were feeling , &quot; well , it doesn &apos;t matter what we do ; eat , drink and be merry , for tomorrow we die .
it &apos;s going to depend which part , say , of america they &apos;re in .
how many more minutes ? two , one ?
and just after that a woman brought me this little bell , and i want to end on this note .
now this is necessary to distinguish the self from the environment .
some architectures .
so it &apos;s acting , in a sense , like a living system trying to preserve itself .
protocell ab likes to dance around for a bit , while protocell b does the fusing , okay ?
these are very dirty little protocells , as a matter of fact .
because , really , what i &apos;m trying to do now is redefine what counts as health .
but by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening -- there &apos;s a few action shots -- your neighbors are likely to say , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
this was vodka and solution , gin and solution .
but if we did this in every single -- every fire hydrant we could redefine the emergency .
you put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building , it &apos;ll heat up , and you &apos;ll get passive airflow .
go down there and buy some of those health food bars , the ones you call bird food , and bring it here and scatter it around .
so there &apos;s business cards down there that &apos;ll give you contact details .
when my father and i started a company to 3d print human tissues and organs , some people initially thought we were a little crazy .
it is also less polarizing for consumers and regulators .
and this leather is 21 layers thick and quite opaque .
by 2050 , it will take 100 billion land animals to provide the world &apos;s population with meat , dairy , eggs and leather goods . maintaining this herd will take a huge , potentially unsustainable toll on the planet . what if there were a different way ? in this eye-opening talk , tissue engineering advocate andras forgacs argues that biofabricating meat and leather is a civilized way to move past killing animals for hamburgers and handbags .
and we wanted to take advantage of moore &apos;s law with electronic controls and software , and we absolutely wanted our car to be connected .
but if you built the alaskan pipeline today , that &apos;s half of what the alaskan pipeline would cost .
i just want to ask one .
like , i remember one day i found my dad convulsing , foaming at the mouth , od-ing on the bathroom floor .
so i began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that i attended , and i really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me .
and we did .
i was born on a farm , a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest &#91; still &#93; .
i lost my faith in our species .
and i went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us , and we started . we started to plant , and this first year we lost a lot of trees , second year less , and slowly , slowly this dead land started to be born again .
coming the other day from atlanta , here , two days ago , i was flying over deserts that we made , we provoked with our own hands .
there are thousands of trees .
landscape ecology concerns itself with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs make habitats for plants and animals .
and if i zoom in to lower manhattan you can see the extent of new york city as it was , right at the end of the american revolution .
we can calculate the aspect .
so , we would read in field guides , the standard field guides that maybe you have on your shelves , you know , what beavers need is &quot; a slowly meandering stream with aspen trees and alders and willows , near the water . &quot; that &apos;s the best thing for a beaver .
and the structure of this is what makes nature work , seen with all its parts .
we can see the fields that the native americans made .
when i &apos;m starting talks like this , i usually do a whole spiel about sustainability because a lot of people out there don &apos;t know what that is .
so , this is what the planet &apos;s going to look like in 20 years .
give you a little peek into our editorial notebook .
but once you also have people living in close proximity to each other , one of the things you can do is -- as information technologies develop -- you can start to have smart places .
but unfortunately , most of the people on the planet don &apos;t live in the cites we live in .
and those things lead to things like this .
we tweak that a lot .
these are indian nurses learning how to use pdas to access databases that have information that they don &apos;t have access to at home in a distant manner .
does anyone know what this is ?
and it &apos;s a copyright violation .
this is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink .
it took them a while to formulate plan b.
and because the biggest producers of content on the internet are not google and yahoo , they &apos;re us , we &apos;re the people getting policed .
sopa is simply a reversion of coica , which was purposed last year , which did not pass .
then , i don &apos;t look it , but i was the indian national squash champion for three years .
i went to this village for the first time .
a traditional midwife is a professional .
so we built the first barefoot college in 1986 .
45 kilowatts of panels on the roof .
this is what we teach in the night schools .
the attendance must not drop . &quot;
you use sign language .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
success story .
our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .
it &apos;s four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom .
we hope that all of you will come to see the allosphere .
so , just give it a moment of thought .
we synthesize happiness , but we think happiness is a thing to be found .
harry s. langerman uttered these words , and he &apos;s somebody you might have known but didn &apos;t , because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by these two brothers named mcdonalds .
i want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for .
ok ? they remember their childhood , but if you walk in and introduce yourself , and then leave the room , when you come back , they don &apos;t know who you are .
&quot; yeah , right &quot; is not the right response !
you &apos;re married to a guy and he picks his nose ?
it &apos;s a very small increase , and it doesn &apos;t much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition .
we should have preferences that lead us into one future over another .
we have a rocketmavericks.com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this , participate , be a spectator .
why do they do it ? it &apos;s for things like this : gene from alabama drives out there with this rocket that he &apos;s built with x-ray sensors , video cameras , festooned with electronics , and he succeeds getting to 100,000 feet , leaving the atmosphere , seeing a thin blue line of space .
my pop , he &apos;s one of the old souls , you know -- old cuban man from camaguey .
and then there are stories that we whisper into a stygian darkness .
&quot; ma &apos;am , did you know that was a light you just ran ? &quot;
blithering fucking idiots .
because now she &apos;s picked up the highway 285 , the perimeter around atlanta , which encompasses now -- there &apos;s seven lanes , she &apos;s on all of them , y &apos;all .
so he &apos;s talking to her , and at some point she says , &quot; then , you know , it was it . that was it . it was done . &quot;
&quot; no , no , no . the only thing with him is , he &apos;s an idiot .
of course , her comeback is , &quot; when have i embarrassed you ? &quot;
i got to look . you got to look .
i jump out next to her going , &quot; don &apos;t you move ! &quot;
and she says , &quot; pardon me , ma &apos;am &quot; -- that &apos;s how we talk down there -- &quot; is that your mother ? &quot;
and i &apos;m really worried , because when people talk about cars -- which i know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking , &quot; let &apos;s use fuel-efficient cars . &quot;
so , how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles ?
the average american spends 19 percent of their income on their car , and there &apos;s a pressure for them to reduce that cost , yet they have no outlet today .
this is my big vision .
what are the incredible weaknesses ?
so , we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast , we can have resilient nationwide communication systems , we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors .
we had close family , good friends , a quiet street .
i spoke to him on the phone at 10 : 30 p.m.
i said i wanted to tell you the awesome story , i wanted to share with you the three as of awesome , and i wanted to leave you with a closing thought .
having a sense of awareness is just about embracing your inner three year-old .
if you notice , he &apos;s actually needlepointing his own face .
i didn &apos;t know what was meat , what was vegetarian .
you can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming .
tourist : i &apos;ve been wanting to come down here since this happened .
dr : well the truth of the matter is , post-september 11th , i felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated , and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me about creating the places we had been creating .
i was actually asked to be a committee chair on an aia committee to rebuild .
there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience .
and atlantic-heydt , who &apos;s the largest scaffolding contractor in the country , volunteered to do it at cost .
you were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation .
so that , very much , is in the realm of things i &apos;ve been interested in before .
dr : john kamen -- who &apos;s here , actually -- put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use .
so in the spirit of full disclosure , i brought some pictures to share .
how many gs ?
isn &apos;t it weird that my 48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car , from the driveway ? &quot;
just two weeks ago , a bill introduced by senator kefalas that would have required athletes , kids under 18 , to wear a helmet when they &apos;re riding their bike died in committee .
so i was curious about why there was a disconnect between the way our society perceives doodling and the way that the reality is .
and here &apos;s the truth : doodling is an incredibly powerful tool , and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn .
because doodling is so universally accessible and it is not intimidating as an art form , it can be leveraged as a portal through which we move people into higher levels of visual literacy .
prices for arvs , the drugs needed to treat hiv , cost about 12,000 &#91; dollars &#93; per patient per year .
it isn &apos;t only the number of drugs that are patented .
nelson is a member of the expert advisory group of the medicines patent pool , and he told me not so long ago , &quot; ellen , we rely in kenya and in many other countries on the medicines patent pool to make sure that new medicines also become available to us , that new medicines , without delay , become available to us . &quot;
let me show you analysis a colleague of mine did looking on different football , world cups , olympic games around the world , looking on the comfort and analyzing the comfort people have perceived at these different sport activities , and let me start with mexico .
if we just look on what happens , we see , temperature &apos;s too high .
this is not only useful for stadia . we can use that also in open-air places and streets , and we &apos;ve been working on the city of the future in masdar , which is in the united emirates , abu dhabi .
even here in doha i found this little nook where you can get alarm clocks and watches fixed , and it &apos;s a lot of tiny little parts . it &apos;s not easy .
and we systematically field tested , because in the field testing we learned some important lessons , and we went through many iterations .
great . good news .
and the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother .
so , if you look at this image , right away you might be able to see that there are clusters of obese and non-obese people in the image .
but you adopt that combination , and then you start gaining weight like them .
and we used a variety of techniques to do this .
maybe , in fact , emotions have a collective existence , not just an individual existence .
now , those people both have four friends , but a &apos;s friends all know each other , and b &apos;s friends do not .
now , what is the point of this ?
i think , in fact , that if we realized how valuable social networks are , we &apos;d spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them , because i think social networks are fundamentally related to goodness .
it &apos;s hardly time to rest on our laurels .
how frustrated are you right now ? -- so that we could get a sense of the kinds of emotions and feelings they were having in their day-to-day lives .
so how can this be ?
laura carstensen : older people are happier
and this is happening every day .
and instead of throwing it out , people would think that &apos;s a krump move , that &apos;s a krump move .
so let &apos;s look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain , and know that when you see these people &apos;s faces that these are not just images of the lakota ; they stand for all indigenous people .
it began carrying , among other things , a large number of hunters who began the wholesale killing of buffalo , eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the sioux .
the american dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left .
1900 : the u.s. indian population reached its low point -- less than 250,000 , compared to an estimated eight million in 1492 .
they &apos;re killing themselves while we watch them die . &quot;
it &apos;s not your business what they do with them .
what &apos;s going on here ?
as a result , 25,000 people a year go blind , hundreds of thousands lose limbs , every year , for something that &apos;s solvable .
should you increase , maintain or decrease the number of fluids ? &quot;
it &apos;s more complex than that .
that &apos;s all it is . ok ?
but the truth of the matter is , you look at that car , it doesn &apos;t look like a volvo , and it doesn &apos;t look like a hummer .
the car swerves to avoid it , and therefore doesn &apos;t get into an accident .
the needle is particularly sharp .
but you know what we do on the last mile ?
we work closely with companies that have operational capacity , or nonprofits that have operational capacity .
and that sugar dough ?
you could do parallel and series circuits for kids using this .
i would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these , so there &apos;s always a client attached to them .
after a week , we took the stencils and the leaves off , shipped the newsprints to lisbon to a very sunny spot , so on day one the billboard said , &quot; complaining is silly . either act or forget . &quot;
now , the shortcut .
so we have an agreement .
yes ?
come to -- no , no , no , no .
yeah ?
so , jack of spades .
excellent .
this is a tough one , because here i must take advantage of -- i switch it with the five of clubs .
do the cameras see the cards now ?
and now and then , i get some extra sympathy points , right ?
ah , this is tough .
i look -- shake the cards , so i don &apos;t .
just kidding , warming up -- king of hearts .
lg : it &apos;s not here ? zoe : it &apos;s not there .
misdirection .
maybe you have this child at home .
and then i got a letter from this gentleman .
actually , i hear a lot , &quot; my husband is tone-deaf . &quot;
if i &apos;d done this with my head you certainly would have thought it .
now , he gets to f-sharp , and finally he goes down to e , but it &apos;s the wrong chord -- because the chord he &apos;s looking for is this one , and instead he does ...
would you think of somebody who you adore , who &apos;s no longer there ?
how would you talk ? how would you be ?
it &apos;s about how many shining eyes i have around me .
but today , against my better judgment , against the advice of my own wife , i want to try to dust off some of those legal skills -- what &apos;s left of those legal skills .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you . how quickly you can solve this problem ? &quot;
and i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s not even close .
software can do it faster .
what happened ? as long as the task involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected : the higher the pay , the better the performance .
it &apos;s an approach built much more around intrinsic motivation .
work on anything you want . &quot;
and i say , &quot; nope . i have proof . &quot;
we already know this . the science confirms what we know in our hearts .
it &apos;s sort of surfing on a magnetic field at the crest of a wave .
it &apos;s balancing on a shaft and a ball , right at the center of gravity , or just slightly above the center of gravity , which means that the lower half of the object is just a little bit more weighty .
and then , this is like projects that are harder to build .
it weighs about 20 tons .
i happen to have triplets .
we have one for the nonprofit sector and one for the rest of the economic world .
in the 1990s , my company created the long distance aidsride bicycle journeys and the 60-mile-long breast cancer three-day walks , and over the course of nine years , we had 182,000 ordinary heroes participate , and they raised a total of 581 million dollars .
well , you put those five things together -- you can &apos;t use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector , you can &apos;t advertise on anywhere near the scale the for-profit sector does for new customers , you can &apos;t take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers that the for-profit sector takes , you don &apos;t have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector , and you don &apos;t have a stock market with which to fund any of this , even if you could do it in the first place , and you &apos;ve just put the nonprofit sector at an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector on every level .
but it absolutely is , especially if it &apos;s being used for growth .
now which pie would we prefer , and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer ?
they are all , you know , warming up and doing stuff .
unlike , for example israel , where audiences cough all the time .
that &apos;s a reason to go out of home . yeah ?
so he says , &quot; if i &apos;m -- if i &apos;m responsible for mozart , this is going to be the only story to be told .
so , no , he doesn &apos;t want that . that &apos;s a different kind of control .
there is a wonderful story about karajan conducting in london .
it &apos;s not a physical thing . it &apos;s in the players &apos; heads .
let &apos;s see the next video , please . see what happens here .
but you need to have process and content to create the meaning .
some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us .
already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
we have the magic porridge pot in the form of walmart and tesco .
it &apos;s open source . it &apos;s something which everybody who &apos;s involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
so basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
but actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively .
i &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky , we &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky .
answer is 26 percent .
the paper said , &quot; it &apos;s not really balanced .
it really is this young versus the old to some degree .
the amount of iq in good numeric analysis , both inside google and microsoft and outside , with analysts and people of various opinions -- should they have spent on that ?
so we need these pieces .
i wanted to become a doctor like paul farmer or rick hodes , these kind of fearless men who go into places like haiti or ethiopia and work with aids patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis , or with children with disfiguring cancers .
just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone , the power and beauty of music transcends the &quot; e &quot; in the middle of our beloved acronym .
however , here &apos;s chris &apos; clock .
now obviously , taste and smell are quite high , but notice sound is at three .
you see , up till now , us designers , we &apos;ve mainly focused on making things look very pretty , and a little bit of touch , which means we &apos;ve ignored the other three senses .
jinsop lee : design for all 5 senses
usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies .
take a look at this sentence : &quot; one morning , as gregor samsa was waking up from anxious dreams , he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug . &quot;
learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend , or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that .
besides , if you continue to act like an artist as you get older , you &apos;ll increasingly feel pressure -- people will question your actions and ask you to act properly .
this is picasso &apos;s .
this shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed , not gone .
i have another experience : in my writing class , i give students a special assignment .
they are devils . devils .
the great artist , then in her 90s , arrived at gimpo airport and a reporter asked her a typical question : &quot; what do you have to do to become a great dancer ?
i was fortunate to join nasa and successfully propose an experiment to fly to venus .
i decided that i did not want them in the future to say , &quot; opa understood what was happening , but he didn &apos;t make it clear . &quot;
that may not sound like much , but when added up over the whole world , it &apos;s enormous .
the physics does not change .
so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe texas and moscow heatwaves were not natural ; they were caused by global warming .
if we had started in 2005 , it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century .
in the old days of the silent movies -- harold lloyd here , hanging famously from the clock hands -- a lot of these guys did their own stunts . they were quite remarkable .
it &apos;s a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer , because it will break your legs very , very quickly if you land on it wrong .
we can flip lorries , coaches , buses , anything over with a nitrogen cannon with enough power .
what &apos;s interesting is we still use cardboard boxes .
and i &apos;d just like to show you a little footage of what he did back then .
this is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there , pushing him in , those turned up jeans .
it &apos;s a three sided box , basically .
and then if the cabin depressurizes while the aircraft is coming back down , in whatever emergency measures , everyone is okay .
one is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here . just the variety of it and the range of it . the second is that it &apos;s put us in a place where we have no idea what &apos;s going to happen , in terms of the future . no idea how this may play out .
and the girl said , &quot; i &apos;m drawing a picture of god . &quot;
and we run our companies like this , by the way .
every one . doesn &apos;t matter where you go .
if you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences , by the way , get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics , and pop into the discotheque on the final night .
we know three things about intelligence .
people weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
sir ken robinson makes an entertaining and profoundly moving case for creating an education system that nurtures creativity .
now , as with any new idea , it wasn &apos;t easy .
i &apos;d say , watch any successful well-written , family-friendly sitcom in the west for your answers .
sadly , this leads me to another three bs that represents how the media in the west talks about us as bombers , billionaires and belly dancers .
heart disease used to be the biggest killer , particularly for men in their 40s .
why are they number one here ?
it depends , of course , on what scale or what scope you want to think about , but this is an organ of surreal complexity , and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it , whether you &apos;re thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections .
if we waited until the heart attack , we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease .
we played with the children , and came back home really tired , exhausted , but with images of bright faces , twinkling eyes , and went to sleep .
our dream is very simple : to send each of these kids , get them prepared to be educated but also to live peacefully , contented in this conflict-ridden chaotic globalized world .
there is also this myth that parents from the slums are not interested in their children going to school ; they &apos;d much rather put them to work .
vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school .
there is an inter-school athletic competition that is held every year in bangalore , where 5,000 children participate from 140 best schools in the city .
and if you ask him what he likes to do he will say , &quot; i like sleeping .
as far as i know , psychophysics is about measuring things .
and suddenly , like a bolt of lightning , the answer came to him .
that &apos;s called &quot; adherence . &quot;
and that &apos;s when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar , and 14 different kinds of mustard , and 71 different kinds of olive oil -- and then eventually even ragu hired howard , and howard did the exact same thing for ragu that he did for prego .
what were they obsessed with in the early &apos; 80s ? they were obsessed with mustard .
what do i mean by that ?
i guess my cancer different from your cancer .
one of my favorites is called subclinical acne .
but i have some good news for you , because i &apos;m a journalist , i like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way .
and it actually took being a journalist to understand all these incentives . you know , economists like to say , there are no bad people , there are just bad incentives .
but dad got really scared : he didn &apos;t want us doing that .
i tend to like science , where what we see and can ascertain are the foundation of what we know .
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content .
comics presents a kind of temporal map .
adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments , so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again and again and again .
we &apos;ll go by this a little quickly -- you get the idea .
but not so with márquez who once praised his translator &apos;s versions as being better than his own , which is an astonishing compliment .
which in my experience means communication that manages to speak to and expand our concept of self-interest .
and just like that , you &apos;ve been seduced into a different way of looking at something because the endorphins have brought down your defenses .
and this isn &apos;t some new phenomenon of our wired world .
and this cartoon hit the bull &apos;s eye .
and the professional , historical linguists in the u.s.
about 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories .
they look -- maybe they look kind of prehistoric and unfinished , abridged perhaps , but in fact , in fact they are the -- they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea , right up there with flat fish .
how do you get insight ?
and you know , the locals think it &apos;s terrible behavior , it &apos;s just horrible watching this happen , day after day .
and we found that they kind of are homebodies .
and to me that -- i don &apos;t think i could say it any better than the immortal bard himself : &quot; one touch of nature makes the whole world kin . &quot;
these blocks represent leds .
usman , the official story is that you learned to play the guitar by watching jimmy page on youtube .
indra saw the woman , a sekhri .
there is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes .
and she created a dance piece which then prime minister nehru saw .
because there is no profit in it .
i think it &apos;s safe to say that all of us here are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives .
you &apos;re v-i-o-l-e-n-t .
and to say all these years of trying to make a better world , and we have failed .
i have an idea . i am going to go to each of these young men and i am going to ask them if they defeated correctly .
so , he wasn &apos;t only thinking about them ; he built one . this is the machine he built .
so it opens up a whole new world , and these people saw it .
they were using vacuum tubes , very narrow , sloppy techniques to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes .
so , he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running , let alone having , you know , software problems .
&quot; picked a lightning bug off the drum . &quot; &quot; running at two kilocycles . &quot;
so it &apos;s almost exactly -- it &apos;s 50 years ago next tuesday , i guess .
it wasn &apos;t any sort of creator intelligence , but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation that would have some intelligence .
it took really three people : barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing ; von neumann saw how you could build the machines -- that now , last count , four million of these von neumann machines is built every 24 hours ; and julian bigelow , who died 10 days ago -- this is john markoff &apos;s obituary for him -- he was the important missing link , the engineer who came in and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work .
we , the adults of the last four generations , have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents .
we need it . the time is now .
justin here , 12 years old , he &apos;s 350 pounds .
let &apos;s start with the main street .
how are you feeling ?
there &apos;s a problem : if you &apos;re not a food expert , and you &apos;ve got tight budgets and it &apos;s getting tighter , then you can &apos;t be creative , you can &apos;t duck and dive and write different things around things .
jo : what do you think this is ? i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ve got one kid , here , having , you know , eight tablespoons of sugar a day .
i know , easier said than done .
absolutely .
it &apos;s incredibly important .
&quot; what do we do now ?
these were the various things that i was looking at as i was trying to understand it .
now carderplanet was very interesting .
he sort of understood the technology , and he realized that security was very important if you were going to be a carder , but he didn &apos;t spend his days and nights bent over a computer , eating pizza , drinking coke and that sort of thing .
born in meridian , idaho .
now i think we &apos;re missing a trick here , because i don &apos;t think people like max vision should be in jail .
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller , mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more , and living in detached buildings , you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of .
we all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place , but that &apos;s really not the case anymore .
we also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools , lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one .
today , the transit , the main street and the new housing have all been built .
here &apos;s what the new main street looks like .
and the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit .
they have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
women go days , weeks , months , without looking at it .
in westchester they call it a &quot; pooky , &quot; in new jersey a &quot; twat . &quot;
and i started this piece , particularly with stories and narratives , and i was talking to one woman and that led to another woman and that led to another woman , and then i wrote those stories down and i put them out in front of other people .
it has taken me to universities all over this country where girls are date-raped and drugged .
she was 21 years old . i went to guatemala and she had sold out the national theater of guatemala .
and always as a child i had this fantasy that somebody would come and rescue me .
so , how do i explain this mysterious affinity ?
mr. teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said , &quot; but why do you steal from me ? if you need money you have only to ask . &quot;
now , you should know that at that time , the textile industry in the south was notoriously segregated .
but it was music that was his greatest passion , especially opera .
&quot; yes , &quot; he said . &quot; that is what the louvre said .
&quot; ez a mi munkank ; es nem is keves . yo napot , pacak ! &quot;
tapestries were portable . you could roll them up , send them ahead of you , and in the time it took to hang them up , you could transform a cold , dank interior into a richly colored setting .
and that , to me , today , is now the challenge and the fun of my job , supporting the vision of my curators , whether it &apos;s an exhibition of samurai swords , early byzantine artifacts , renaissance portraits , or the show we heard mentioned earlier , the mcqueen show , with which we enjoyed so much success last summer .
from there , you can walk in any direction to almost any culture .
that &apos;s the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
because the last 20 years , the somali woman has stood up .
so dr. deqo has to explain .
when they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
and my question is this : &quot; why are we ignoring the oceans ? &quot;
in fact , i have another version at my office and i ask people , &quot; why are there mountains here , on this area here , but there are none over here ? &quot; and they go , &quot; well , gee , i don &apos;t know , &quot; saying , &quot; is it a fracture zone ? is it a hot spot ? &quot;
this is on a mercator projection .
that &apos;s why you get , you know , you get seashells up on mount everest .
and when we cut them open , they didn &apos;t have the anatomy of a clam .
all the way at the other end , in an alkaline environment , at a ph of 11 , life existed .
because there &apos;s no oxygen there , it &apos;s the largest reservoir of hydrogen sulfide on earth . shipwrecks are perfectly preserved .
and within that , we &apos;re going to run it just like you run a nuclear submarine , blue-gold team , switching them off and on , running 24 hours a day .
and when you get a jaw drop , you can inform .
this makes education unaffordable for many people .
rg : hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine .
some students took their certificate and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled for actual college credit .
here , every single student has to engage with the material .
around each one of our courses , a community of students had formed , a global community of people around a shared intellectual endeavor .
but when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer , it &apos;s kind of hard to miss .
i think what he was complaining about is not universities but rather the lecture-based format that so many universities spend so much time on .
thank you .
but only two percent don &apos;t know the effect that the debacle in argentina will have on the imf &apos;s monetary policy -- seems a contradiction .
when we say &quot; i , &quot; -- as when rene descartes said , &quot; i think therefore i am , &quot; -- we mean the head .
now we have to picture alan greenspan in a black leather corset , with a butt tattoo that says , &quot; whip inflation now . &quot;
and i really learned this lesson during the sex scandals of the clinton administration or , or as i call them , the good ol &apos; days .
i used to actually hang up on them .
it only takes two years to learn how to talk .
that accidents , that louis kahn , who talked about accidents , this is another quality of the trickster .
yes of course you got that . thank you very much .
you &apos;re into something that occupies space and inhabits time .
which leads me to a videotape of a president bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago .
pills alone don &apos;t do it , especially in clinically depressed people .
we have got to develop the idea that the earth doesn &apos;t last forever , our sun doesn &apos;t last forever .
this is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about .
and in my opinion , we don &apos;t spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what &apos;s safe to do on earth .
so , there &apos;s a fairly simple solution to this .
there &apos;s no reason why we shouldn &apos;t start now .
you know , 10 years ago , or 15 years ago , really , you walk into an astronomy convention , and you say , &quot; you know , there &apos;s probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy , &quot; and they &apos;re going to hoot you off the stage .
it passed directly through earth &apos;s orbit . we were in that that spot six hours earlier .
we really need a dedicated observatory .
for a moment , what i need to do is project something on the screen of your imagination .
the system isn &apos;t chesapeake bay .
now a layer in , the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting , partly as a function of temperature , partly as a function of all the other factors , and you &apos;ve got a really complicated system .
and many of you remember the early stages of oceanography , when we had to use what we had at our fingertips .
fiber : next-generation way of communicating .
and we &apos;re going to go down into the axial seamount using animation .
it &apos;s smaller than a postage stamp , and it can generate power just by being attached to your shirt as you move .
they sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor during an eruption , which have the microbes that have never been to the surface of the planet before .
and yet , when i look at the environment outside , you see how resistant architecture is to change .
but architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better .
it &apos;s not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms .
too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story , but the story is very short , which says , &quot; we have no story to tell you . &quot;
of course that means that architecture is political .
you know frank gehry &apos;s buildings , they will continue to be unexpected in the future .
critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way .
risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent .
there is so many interests . there &apos;s money . there &apos;s political power .
daniel libeskind : 17 words of architectural inspiration
in fact , we applied a lot of rocket design techniques to make the car light despite having a very large battery pack .
but whenever you &apos;ve got really new technology , it generally takes about three major versions in order to make it a compelling mass-market product .
the whole ecosystem is solar-powered .
i mean , how do you , the company , benefit ?
and so i tell people , well , i was trying to figure out the fastest way to turn a large fortune into a small one .
all rockets that fly today are fully expendable .
we dressed a cowboy as johnny cash and bolted the mannequin to the rocket .
physics is really figuring out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive , like quantum mechanics .
most people that are following the story of angelina jolie and brad pitt will know where namibia is .
whenever we tried to hunt , we were called poachers .
do you have anybody in your communities , or people , that know the bush very well and that know wildlife very well ?
and sometimes , once they were caught , they were treated with respect , brought back into the communities and they were made part of the bigger dreams .
they stay very much far away because this other thing has multiplied from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals .
i want to know the people behind my dinner choices .
do i do this three times a week ?
and the best part is all of those ingredients are available to every family at the neighborhood walmart .
as a chef , i realize the easiest thing for me to do is reduce the portion sizes on my plate .
invite your friends and neighbors over and repeat once a year , maybe .
we &apos;ve seen an image of our blue planet , our world bank .
what do the computer models say about this , that and the other thing ?
it &apos;s a big undertaking . i stand here before you tonight as an ambassador for my whole team .
it &apos;s been a remorseless , steady increase .
now we turn on our time lapse .
that &apos;s where it started .
or if you take an american reference , to the u.s. capitol building and you pack 3,000 capitol buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
and for the last four years , my coauthor phanish puranam and i spent investigating this topic .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of india .
what happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart , young , ambitious kids on a call center job ?
as many of you know , ibm has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies .
it is four in the morning . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t die on dench &apos;s birthday .
and how far down into it you figure we &apos;ll have to scroll to get to the golden ticket ?
and once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions , again either personally or with our loved ones and family members , we also very quickly learn the benefits , the trade-offs and the limitations of these tools .
importantly , those special proteins are among the most highly charged objects in our body .
10 years ago , dr. palti founded a company called novocure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
he received high dose radiation to the head .
by month 12 , we could argue whether there &apos;s a little bit of material around the edges , but it &apos;s essentially completely gone .
there &apos;s research underway now at harvard medical school to pick the optimum pairs to maximize that benefit .
but for the desert society this is no program ; this is their life .
it can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon .
in many portions , water hyacinth covered these big canals like anything .
or , if you want to paint , you can paint it blue throughout because every roof which you see in this picture collects rainwater drops and deposit in the rooms .
but this is not ground water .
they say that a picture is worth a thousand words , so we can say a thousand words right now , an another thousand words .
these are the trees .
the battle against malaria is being won , with deaths from malaria down 27 percent , according to the latest world bank data .
ten percent &apos;s come from india .
they will get the textiles jobs that will take people out of rural poverty and put them on the road to industrialization and wealth .
and the countries on the right hand side , you &apos;ll see the per capita gdp , basically every country with a per capita gdp of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , has got a corruption score of roughly , what &apos;s that , about three ?
ignore the scale on the bottom for a second .
no , not right now , just 30 seconds .
to put it very simply , the assumption so far has been that if you give people enough connectivity , if you give them enough devices , democracy will inevitably follow .
and police said that it happened because he was playing hide and seek , which is &quot; elude the cat &quot; in chinese slang , with other inmates and hit his head against the wall , which was not an explanation which sat well with many chinese bloggers .
and finally , the purpose of any authoritarian deliberation efforts is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes , both at home and abroad .
so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space , a total rip-off from abraham maslow .
daddy &apos;s got you . that &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
the thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me props , lifting me up , for not crying .
he was having sex .
i go in his room . on his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named sheila .
you see , we have to come to understand that less value , property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can &apos;t happen without it .
is it the economy ? well , we have now the fifth-largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity terms .
but , what perhaps some of you don &apos;t realize is how far we &apos;ve come to get there .
and he whipped out his cellphone , dialed the number , and a voice said , &quot; i &apos;m up here . &quot;
one simple fact : you couldn &apos;t try to call an afghan at 8 : 30 in the evening .
it &apos;s a civilizational story to begin with .
we &apos;ve got all of that .
and i sat , and i was like , &quot; man , i would buy that , eh ? &quot;
after seeing that global impact , we narrowed it down to our key value proposition , which was cleanliness and convenience .
so you can take a bacteria that really doesn &apos;t make these things at all , and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street .
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
and , of course , we are amused by jokes because they are funny .
what we see with , say , chocolate cake is it &apos;s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring .
why are babies cute ? why is cake sweet ? philosopher dan dennett has answers you wouldn &apos;t expect , as he shares evolution &apos;s counterintuitive reasoning on cute , sweet and sexy things .
but as they learn to become adults , they become much more sensitive to the opinions of others , and they lose that freedom and they do start to become embarrassed .
so if somebody can reach under the chair that &apos;s next to them , you &apos;ll find something taped underneath it .
all right . i think i &apos;m going to take these off now , because i can &apos;t see a damn thing when i &apos;ve -- all right , ok .
of course they will . but they &apos;ll also ask , &quot; what can i do with it ? &quot;
no ? oh ! somebody did . fantastic .
now , actually , he gave the test before the drugs and after the drugs , to see what the difference was in people &apos;s facility and speed with coming up with ideas .
now , while the eameses were exploring those possibilities , they were also exploring physical objects .
they don &apos;t necessarily even have to go into some kind of formal workshop to do it .
because when children play a role , they actually follow social scripts quite closely that they &apos;ve learnt from us as adults .
we &apos;re trying on these experiences .
i think this is particularly true if we think about the sort of -- i think what &apos;s very different about design is that we go through these two very distinctive modes of operation .
i can just sit back and relax . &quot;
and he put me on anti-depressants .
richard st. john : success is a continuous journey
the most transformative experience i &apos;ve ever had -- in that single moment , hearing dissonance and harmony and people singing , people together , the shared vision .
now i should say , before that , what i did is i posted a conductor track of myself conducting .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
i feel a closeness to this choir -- almost like a family .
and i &apos;d like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people to do things .
but the problem is , as foucault points out , that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side .
ethics was about the question of how to live life well .
because it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life -- the good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching , the others listening , in which it is about , learning is done while sitting , in which you learn for yourself , in which you &apos;re not supposed to change these rules because the chairs are fixed to the ground .
what does your chair say about what you value ? designer sebastian deterding shows how our visions of morality and what the good life is are reflected in the design of objects around us . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we wanted to engage them , to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves .
more important is motivation and determination .
and so today i &apos;ll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike , work that i &apos;ve done in collaboration with wyatt korff and roy caldwell .
and low light is a critical issue with filming animals , because if it &apos;s too high , you fry them .
this was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes .
and what &apos;s shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built that &apos;s 87 and a half feet spanwise .
now , things -- i &apos;m making this sound very easy , this is actually a lot of work .
so really , just an amazing image , slowed down extremely , to extremely slow speeds .
so sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure right in the middle of their spring .
now , you &apos;re not as thick as two short planks , but you sound like it when you say &quot; earth , &quot; because that demonstration , if i turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper .
you notice that jim cameron is sitting in a seat .
and the craft that i &apos;m in -- this hasn &apos;t been shown before .
now , there she goes , right overhead .
what comes next in 30 seconds ? i can &apos;t tell you .
here &apos;s a map of my city , new york city , showing inundation in red .
and so the core idea here was to hit the reset button and regenerate an ecology over time that was regenerative and cleaning and productive .
and finally , how much fun it would be to watch the flupsy parade and cheer on the oyster spats as they go down to the reef .
and what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody , that was creating these diseases that would wipe through the city every three or four years .
he suspected an outbreak that concentrated would probably involve a single point source .
it &apos;s a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life , the life that we &apos;re enjoying here today . thank you very much .
so i was in dharamsala meeting these people , and i &apos;d spent about five weeks there , and i was hearing these similar stories of these refugees that had poured out of tibet into dharamsala .
and the young people , young tibetans , are starting to say , listen , this doesn &apos;t work .
and i was -- i usually travel alone when i do my work , but i did this -- i hosted a program for discovery , and when i went down with the team , i was quite concerned about going in with a whole bunch of people , especially into the huaorani , deep into the huaorani tribe .
and this is -- i see this rolling out all over -- this is our site in ollantaytambo , peru , four years ago , where they first saw their first computers ; now they have computers in their classrooms .
this is an old mayan funeral chant that he got from his grandfather .
it &apos;s a very large number of galaxies .
there &apos;s the galaxy in the middle , which is the milky way , and around that are the hubble -- you know , nearby kind of galaxies , and there &apos;s a sphere that marks the different times .
so let me show you some of nature &apos;s patterns that are the result of this .
and you &apos;ll see , first , the structure of the survey , and then you &apos;ll start seeing the structure of the galaxies that we see out there .
and when a number of filaments come together in a knot , that makes a supercluster of galaxies .
and we &apos;re going to fly around , and we &apos;ll fly around , and you &apos;ll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect , and you get a large cluster of galaxies .
so there it is .
so that &apos;s where we are today , and that &apos;s what i wanted to give you a flavor of .
so i was about 11 when i went along to my first meditation class .
at the same time , this sort of constant mind-wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness .
you know , this is crazy . we do this all the time , even on an everyday level .
so to compensate , i &apos;d hold the pen tighter , and this progressively made the shake worse , so i &apos;d hold the pen tighter still .
but as i searched around in the darkness , i realized i was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that i never had before .
so the end image was never visible as a physical whole .
in art school , phil hansen developed an unruly tremor in his hand that kept him from creating the pointillist drawings he loved . hansen was devastated , floating without a sense of purpose . until a neurologist made a simple suggestion : embrace this limitation ... and transcend it .
many were bulldozed under at the time of the accident , but a few are left like this , kind of silent vestiges to the tragedy .
greenpeace and other organizations put that number in the tens of thousands .
her text said , &quot; mom , you will rock . &quot;
so just to take some quick examples : people text or do email during corporate board meetings .
i &apos;m the one who doesn &apos;t want to be interrupted .
over and over i hear , &quot; i would rather text than talk . &quot;
but when i stepped back , i felt myself at the cold , hard center of a perfect storm .
so before it was : i have a feeling , i want to make a call .
there &apos;s plenty of time for us to reconsider how we use it , how we build it .
we spend an evening on the social network instead of going to the pub with friends .
never try to be better than someone else , always learn from others . never cease trying to be the best you can be -- that &apos;s under your control .
and there a builder . upward rise the arch of a church he builds , wherein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ .
the youngsters didn &apos;t have to feel that we were going to keep them over .
and we forget there is no progress without change .
don &apos;t whine . don &apos;t complain . don &apos;t make excuses .
i &apos;d want one to realize that defense usually wins championships , and would work hard on defense .
with profound simplicity , coach john wooden redefines success and urges us all to pursue the best in ourselves . in this inspiring talk he shares the advice he gave his players at ucla , quotes poetry and remembers his father &apos;s wisdom .
over the last 20 years , we &apos;ve basically tackled that .
or if we &apos;re going to use larger structures to replace larger structures , we can then use the patient &apos;s own cells , or some cell population , and the biomaterials , the scaffolds , together .
another technology that we &apos;ve used is actually that of printing .
so we go layer by layer through the organ , analyzing each layer as we go through the organ , and we then are able to send that information , as you see here , through the computer and actually design the organ for the patient .
i couldn &apos;t go out and play basketball at recess without feeling like i was going to pass out when i got back inside .
all i wanted to do was to get better , and i didn &apos;t realize how amazing it really was until now that i &apos;m older and i see the amazing things that he &apos;s doing .
so how easily could i swap our unwanted copy of &quot; 24 &quot; for a wanted copy of &quot; sex and the city ? &quot;
over the next minute , you &apos;re going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display of all the dots that went on in my head .
one , a renewed belief in the importance of community , and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means .
that power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes in its entire lifetime .
i don &apos;t want the dvd ; i want the movie it carries .
because i really believe it can disrupt outdated modes of business , help us leapfrog over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption and teach us when enough really is enough .
and every time , they sent scouts out there to make sure no one attacked them .
so last july ... i moved from america in june , ran in july election and won .
when we finally got out the back door , transformers were burning in the street .
co : yeah , but we don &apos;t even know what houses are accepting help at this point .
the other point is that it is hard .
and this is the curve for the dallas tornadoes in april where we deployed software .
imagine if we could have these systems ready to go in a place before a disaster .
and this is sultanbelyi , which is one of the largest squatter communities in istanbul .
this was southland , a small shanty community on the western side of nairobi , kenya .
&apos;it &apos;s a simple life , but nobody is restricting you .
this is the main drag of rocinha , the estrada da gavea , and there &apos;s a bus route that runs through it , lots of people out on the street .
and when they have more money they cement their streets , and they put in sewers and good water pipes , and stuff like that .
and there were three old ladies who lived in -- that &apos;s her self-built house behind her -- and they &apos;ve lived there for 30 or 40 years , and they are the backbone of the community there .
but let me tell you a bit about it today .
but i thank you here , lois , from this platform .
but , you know , i could pop a book on in the middle of the night , and -- now , the kurzweil reader is simply a program on my laptop .
of course , talking books for the blind predated all this technology .
the technology will advance even further , but i can still remember my mum saying , 60 years ago , &quot; remember , darling , you &apos;ll never be able to read the print with your fingers . &quot;
it will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050 .
biochemist gregory petsko makes a convincing argument that , in the next 50 years , we &apos;ll see an epidemic of neurological diseases , such as alzheimer &apos;s , as the world population ages . his solution : more research into the brain and its functions .
we are seeing an amazing flourishing taking place .
this is not the kind of societal problem that i am concerned about .
the robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two , so the classic econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine : encourage entrepreneurship , double down on infrastructure , and make sure we &apos;re turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills .
we &apos;re not going to fix things for them by sending them back to montessori .
and most people , both within and outside the organized church , still have a picture of a celestial controller , a rule maker , a policeman in the sky who orders everything , and causes everything to happen .
it isn &apos;t a time for explanation , or preaching , or theology ; it &apos;s a time for tears .
we have a pram service on tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children .
a god who looks after his own , so that christians are ok , while everyone else perishes ?
early religious thought conceived god as a sort of superhuman person , doing things all over the place .
in the end , we have to say , &quot; i don &apos;t know . &quot;
tom honey : why would god create a tsunami ?
if we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today -- and i mean everything , from blades to scrapers to cloth -- we as a species would not live very long .
so , long before the industrial age we &apos;ve been affecting the planet on a global scale , with just a small amount of technology .
i call this entire thing -- us humans as our technology , everything that we &apos;ve made , gadgets in our lives -- we call that the technium . that &apos;s this world .
that &apos;s where technology is going .
so , technology is selfish ; technology is generous .
there are no bad technologies , just as there are no bad children .
so , i &apos;m going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization called 826 valencia , and then i &apos;m going to talk about how we all might join in and do similar things .
and the idea was to put mcsweeney &apos;s -- mcsweeney &apos;s quarterly , that we published twice or three times a year , and a few other magazines -- we were going to move it into an office for the first time .
so we opened this place . and this is a vat that we fill with treasures that students dig in .
you know , it &apos;s been proven that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention , a student can get one grade level higher .
a bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world .
we &apos;re working on our college essays . send them in . &quot;
now we &apos;re sort of addicted to the book thing .
it wasn &apos;t a non-profit buried , you know , on the 30th floor of some building downtown . it was right in the neighborhood that it was serving , and it was open all the time to the public .
so you can see the full effect !
this is l.a. , the echo park time travel mart : &quot; whenever you are , we &apos;re already then . &quot;
you email him , he &apos;ll answer any question you possibly want .
this is my story .
we have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels , drawdown timelines , surges and sting operations , when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn , where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going .
we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars .
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don &apos;t start investing in women and girls .
i humbly add -- humbly add -- that out beyond the worlds of war and peace , there is a field , and there are many women and men &#91; who &#93; are meeting there .
i opened up a magazine , and visa &apos;s branding was , &quot; business takes simplicity . &quot;
i &apos;m at this place called the media lab .
and there was this person , muriel cooper .
so , if you sort of compare that , like this , you &apos;ll see that computer versus human -- i &apos;ve been tracking this for the last year -- computer versus human over the last year has changed .
tomorrow , paola antonelli is speaking . i love paola .
in japan , it &apos;s a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece . who &apos;s done that before ? one-piece clementine ?
the car is so big , the camera is so small , yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual .
when you want less , it &apos;s because it &apos;s about work .
but if any of you people ask , &quot; what actually goes up ? does anything go up ?
and she said , &quot; you know , if you dyed your hair black , you would look just like al gore . &quot;
but the difference is , on earth , most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere , deposited in the ground as coal , oil , natural gas , etc . on venus , most of it is in the atmosphere . the difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average . on venus , it &apos;s 855 . this is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible , and putting it into the atmosphere .
but we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . this is in bolivia -- over thirty years .
we can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought australia had to change our political culture .
ag : the answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , i think that we should feel really great about the fact that the republican nominee -- certain nominee -- john mccain , and both of the finalists for the democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis . all three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . and i think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . but the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the league of conservation voters , by the way , the analysis of all the questions -- and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the orwellian label , &quot; clean coal . &quot; has anybody noticed that ?
what &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
he doesn &apos;t want to put high-speed internet at home .
new sensing elements on the body -- you can grow hairs on your nails , and therefore grab some of the particles from another person .
so , we &apos;ll be able to really not have any excuse to be wearing everything leather in the future .
and same thing here , social tele-presence .
also , the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more .
he &apos;s working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls that explain to children where babies come from today .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
why should there be order in war ?
can we create the kind of patterns that we &apos;re seeing in places like iraq ?
and it stays there through the invasion of fallujah until the samarra bombings in the iraqi elections of &apos; 06 .
this , in a way , is one of the challenges of how to interpret a really good idea .
and , of course , you can &apos;t do that unless you understand yourself a bit more .
what does this compassion entail ?
and as he was dozing off , they were reading from the book of leviticus in the torah .
every week , the cleaner would come . &quot; god you &apos;ve answered my plea again . &quot;
and it &apos;s from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
you can see that the arm is discolored , purplish in color .
the nervous system has plasticity .
the dinosaurs had a really bad day .
that would be bad .
but if it came over a city , an important city -- not that any city is more important than others , but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization .
it &apos;s roughly 250 yards across , so it &apos;s pretty big -- big size , you know , bigger than a football stadium -- and it &apos;s going to pass by the earth in april of 2029 .
if we need , if we see an asteroid that &apos;s coming toward us , and it &apos;s headed right for us , and we have two years to go , boom ! we hit it .
but we &apos;d be rich !
seen from another point of view , it gives quite a different impression .
once they threaten your advertisers , market forces are actually , you know , destroyed , and the advertisers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and advertise .
actually , i underestimated the atrocities , i have to admit .
you see , at the level of a concept , it was a great concept .
and that &apos;s the best they could do .
the city was closed until early &apos; 90s because , of all things , they were producing glass for tupolev planes .
if you take the camera above , you start thinking about these numbers again .
but the point is , if we ever survive to actually issue them , find enough investors that this can be considered a success , there &apos;s nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring .
we &apos;ll be talking about them .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
you &apos;ve heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway .
coulomb , in france , found the same law for electric charges .
the last two , the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields .
there &apos;s the story , which is not absolutely certain to be right , but a lot of people told it .
it doesn &apos;t diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things , plus accidents .
but he read books in every spare moment he could find .
so fueled by that ambition , he returned to the state legislature .
but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a new year &apos;s reception .
we had a big dance at the white house .
and he started out , &quot; doris , more than any other woman i have ever known ... &quot; and my heart sank .
the lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other , and when anyone was knowing lincoln was in town , they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories .
which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away .
so he said , &quot; look , i &apos;ll tell you something .
and as you can see , it &apos;s been knocked about a bit , which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879 .
they &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
the empire of iran , the medes and the persians , united under cyrus , became the first great world empire .
after alexander , the other empires , babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon .
and the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion .
it becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all iranians -- muslims and non-muslims , christians , zoroastrians , jews living in iran , people who are devout , not devout .
it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta .
they communicate their delight to their children , who respond with smiles , and a desire to achieve more and to learn more .
across all of these diverse lands and cultures , the institutions , and the child &apos;s journey through them , is depressingly similar .
many countries have developed national action plans for change .
maybe i can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference .
he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki .
for me , it was really about the process .
and working with ngos and building this case .
and obviously he never came down . the statement was never made .
we started moving around the corridors of the u.n. system , governments and ngos , trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it , see if we could make it possible .
so these guys were absolutely crucial .
we went back to afghanistan , because the next year was coming , and we wanted to support .
and you can see the education box there .
he said , &quot; no , i &apos;d talk to the individuals . &quot;
and yet , one is a chimp , and the other is a cow .
maybe the problem was with the basic assumption that all brains are made in the same way .
a brain that huge would be crushed by its own weight , and this impossible brain would go in the body of 89 tons .
and what we found is that because neurons are so expensive , there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex , and i think that &apos;s the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
and i became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body , so you couldn &apos;t see where the skin ended and the near environment started .
i work for the red cross and i &apos;m a physical therapist .
it &apos;s 21 years , but they are still all there .
why don &apos;t you have the artificial legs ? &quot;
i said , &quot; no .
we knew that many more patients could not come , prevented by the fighting .
you know , 50 meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed , but we managed to reach the shelter .
now help me not to be a beggar anymore . &quot;
i said , &quot; listen , it &apos;s insane .
and you know what ?
i have a wish , a big wish , that this way of working , this way of thinking , is going to be implemented in other countries .
like many of you here , i am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in africa .
start all over again .
i got lucky .
and it was brilliant to be part of this team .
i couldn &apos;t just stay in seattle and raise my kids in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it .
that if we involve them in their education , if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront -- that our whole society confronts -- and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world , that magic will happen .
i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government .
patrick awuah makes the case that a liberal arts education is critical to forming true leaders .
and we can measure this very , very precisely with kepler and trace their effects .
and it makes a very bad microphone ; i &apos;ve tried it many times .
i &apos;m an actor who plays a specific part .
good bye . &quot;
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
he just doesn &apos;t care .
duh .
the answer may surprise you .
i think that something needs to be done about this .
she did accept and then backed away .
so when this machine breaks , the machines they have to work with break , they &apos;ve got to try and figure it out , but most of the time , that &apos;s the end of the road .
35 million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia .
the only difference is that now you &apos;re only working with 21 percent oxygen .
well we &apos;ve seen good results so far .
the idea , the dream , was really for a sort of bauhaus sort of school where new ideas were interrogated and investigated , the creation of a new visual language based on the african creative heritage .
the vai people of liberia had a long tradition of literacy before their first contact with europeans in the 1800s .
and why do i say it ?
maybe a few lung diseases here and there , but , you know , that &apos;s not such a big deal .
either they &apos;re outvoted by puppets of agribusiness , or they are puppets of agribusiness .
everyone was a locavore : even new york had pig farms nearby , and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion .
in new york , an orange was a common christmas present , because it came all the way from florida .
now , someone had to eat all that stuff , so we got fast food .
the chicken is fed corn , and then its meat is ground up , and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder , and then it &apos;s fried in corn oil .
70 percent of the agricultural land on earth , 30 percent of the earth &apos;s land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we &apos;ll eat .
less meat , less junk , more plants .
i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution .
all right , so let &apos;s take four subjects that obviously go together : big data , tattoos , immortality and the greeks .
so lesson number one : sisyphus .
thank you .
suppose we approximated one person with one book ?
everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees .
i think that &apos;s a big , big problem .
we have skin enhancements , clothing .
all of these would enable , in principle -- be amenable to enhancement .
it &apos;s a part of the space that &apos;s accessible to animals ; since we are animals , we are a subset of that .
and i &apos;m wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces .
but then i started dreaming of having six colors .
you &apos;ve got gravity , you &apos;ve got the centrifugal force , you &apos;ve got the fluid dynamics .
so i think , conceivably , those could be predictive .
and to interface with it , with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do , giving them pigment and paint just like an artist , it &apos;s a good ally .
about a year later , i get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of stuffed animals in the trash , and suddenly i have more toys than i &apos;ve ever had in my whole life .
tania luna : how a penny made me feel like a millionaire
so i started thinking and listing what all it was that i thought would make a perfect biennial .
and i &apos;m such a technician , so i loved this project , getting to play with all the techniques .
the sun rises , and it melts away .
and whatever he makes somehow references nesting and space and personal property .
and a dig jig -- a dig jig is where , for a milestone anniversary or a birthday , you gather all your friends and family together and you dance on where you &apos;re going to be buried .
the next artist is hazel clausen .
next is ginger cheshire .
thank you . thanks .
this , too , is origami , and this shows where we &apos;ve gone in the modern world .
if we obey these laws , we can do amazing things .
the last step is not so hard , but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that &apos;s hard .
what do i need ? i need a lot of circles .
and you can do more than just insects .
it &apos;s an artist &apos;s rendition , but it flew in a japanese telescope in 1995 .
but this is a five-meter telescope -- has about a quarter-mile focal length .
and as weird and surprising as it may sound , origami may someday even save a life .
it &apos;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle .
certainly this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had great progress with women .
they were basically asked by one of their clients who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future .
what it &apos;s about is that the economy has changed a lot .
people have asked men , why don &apos;t they just go back to college , to community college , say , and retool themselves , learn a new set of skills ?
basically , the way they said it to me is that they would be working 18 hours a day , that their husband would maybe have a job , but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies .
over several decades , south korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about .
so for a long time in the economic sphere , we &apos;ve lived with the term &quot; glass ceiling . &quot;
and i tried , as a child , as a teenager , to read philosophy and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways that i could see as a possible answer to that question .
and he says by describing it as an ecstatic state .
and he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself .
i couldn &apos;t improve on this as a good example of how flow enters the workplace .
relaxation is fine -- you still feel ok .
where do you see your doctor and your dentist ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they pretty much had their sense of home , their sense of community , even their sense of enmity , assigned to them at birth , and didn &apos;t have much chance of stepping outside of that .
where you come from now is much less important than where you &apos;re going .
and at my feet was the great , still blue plate of the pacific ocean .
movement is a fantastic privilege , and it allows us to do so much that our grandparents could never have dreamed of doing .
so thank you very much .
a lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the western population moved over to here .
and they will start to buy electric cars .
can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
this will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
now , we know about smoking , deep-fried mars bars , chips -- the glasgow diet .
it also dilates the coronary arteries , so it stops angina .
and we then thought to ourselves , with those big stores , i wonder if sunlight might activate those stores and release them from the skin , where the stores are about 10 times as big as what &apos;s in the circulation .
so what we &apos;ve next done is we &apos;ve moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation .
we think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within britain , it &apos;s of relevance to us .
medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive .
your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that &apos;s ready to take over at the time of injury . it happens every day .
what do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter ?
you &apos;re going to place this in an oven-like device .
we brought patients in , six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery , did x-rays , and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient &apos;s size pelvic cavity .
it &apos;s actually printing this two chamber heart , one layer at a time .
they are actually making urine .
but it takes a lot to get there .
and that is really very simple , to make our patients better .
i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish -- the old parable : &quot; if you give a man a fish , you feed him for a day .
it &apos;s probably why i &apos;m a little bit panicked right now -- other than all the caffeine that i &apos;ve had and the sugar -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to an mba program .
at seven years old i figured it out . i got three and a half cents for a thousand coat hangers .
so that &apos;s obvious , right .
and making money off that too .
meanwhile , my friends were working for five hours to haul some guy &apos;s bag around and get paid 10 bucks .
this is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you &apos;re trying to extract money from all your friends all the time .
and then you know what we do ? we negotiate .
when you see grumpy customer service , point that out to them .
but how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there with the rest of them as well ?
expertise has for sure had its moments .
and that was only the beginning .
when the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward .
social activists , business leaders , lawyers , politicians , professionals will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good .
and there will be and should be those who spend a lifetime pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry .
okay , speaker lawrence lessig , right .
but they &apos;re very keen that we don &apos;t let money drop into that relationship , else it turns into something like this .
and so they &apos;re beautiful , but this libertarian has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this .
the point is they , he , here , gets that culture .
the creator is a sharecropper in this story .
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced .
it &apos;s a value respecting the creator .
if they stick with the process , if they stick with it , they end up doing amazing things and they surprise themselves just how innovative they and their teams really are .
and they were holding it in their laps .
and this was really disappointing to doug , because before this time he was proud of what he did .
a few years ago i felt a lump on the side of my neck , and it was my turn in the mri machine .
it would be really great if you didn &apos;t let people divide the world into the creatives and the non-creatives , like it &apos;s some god-given thing , and to have people realize that they &apos;re naturally creative .
this is a picture of tim , who , right when i snapped this picture , reminded me , he said , &quot; jessica , the last lab group i worked in i was doing fieldwork in the costa rican rainforest , and things have changed dramatically for me . &quot;
i am collaborating with charlie brown .
our bodies and homes are covered in microbes -- some good for us , some bad for us . as we learn more about the germs and microbes who share our living spaces , fellow jessica green asks : can we design buildings that encourage happy , healthy microbial environments ?
and he was so inspired by this article , it kind of directed the rest of his life .
byte magazine and communications at the acm had special issues covering hypertext .
there was a guy called gary kildall who went flying his plane when ibm came looking for an operating system for the ibm pc , and he wasn &apos;t there , so they went back to see bill gates .
i think this means &quot; divine power of the ocean &quot; in a polynesian language .
everyone wants to hear their news anchor say , &quot; mister splashy pants . &quot;
alexis ohanian : how to make a splash in social media
i just wanted to use my skills and build a school .
in this school , there was a simple idea : to create comfort in a classroom .
the openings are letting the hot air out and light in .
usually , for a young man from gando to earn money , you have to leave the country to the city , sometimes leave the country and some never come back , making the community weaker .
it &apos;s new technology . you look through them and the world you see is augmented with data : names of places , monuments , buildings , maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street .
voice : if you total all the spots on a deck of cards , the result is 365 .
mt : yeah , but i guess my hand is better . we beat the odds .
it is not . it is also shaped equally by history and culture .
and what does it mean ?
it doesn &apos;t work .
and the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in china is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
and was finally completed in the seventh century a.d.
what is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
accelerometers on each hand read hand position .
so i picked up my banjo and i nervously played four songs that i actually knew with them .
like the time i was in sichuan province and i was singing for kids in relocation schools in the earthquake disaster zone .
&quot; that &apos;s cool . &quot;
november 2005 : the streets are burning .
so with my friend marco , we decided to go there and see who are the real palestinians and who are the real israelis .
we &apos;re in ramallah right now .
i called that project women are heroes .
but that &apos;s okay .
so you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women .
then art becomes useful .
each project -- that &apos;s a film from women are heroes .
we just did some pasting in los angeles on another project in the last weeks .
art can change the way we see the world .
and it &apos;s starting to look at -- not always and not for everything -- but in certain moments of time , access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them .
they did not invent car-sharing .
any guesses ?
so if i have a terrific experience and i tweet it , or i tell five people standing next to me , news travels .
essentially , there are all sorts of restaurants in oakland , near where i live .
lisa gansky : the future of business is the &quot; mesh &quot;
what happens in one place very quickly affects everything else .
the other major development is going to be in the area of what can happen in genetics .
this could be our best century ever because of the achievements , or it could be our worst .
i don &apos;t play sports . i &apos;m really bad at sports .
i must have done about 30,000 caricatures .
anyway , the next slide i &apos;m about to show you -- should i just turn that off ?
so i decided , i &apos;m going to learn to paint by myself .
the best collaboration , of course , is with children .
i have to travel seven oceans , and i have to come and see you .
and you won &apos;t believe it , we put together a list of 7,000 people , who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list , but i was determined to bring them to india , so -- a lot of them were in india .
if they wanted beauty , i said , this is the beauty i &apos;m willing to give you . it &apos;s politicized .
and two magical things happened after he was born .
i whipped out my pen , and i started drawing on her head and i drew a crown for her .
einstein &apos;s especially interested in penelope &apos;s talk .
e : &#91; squawks &#93; sw : yeah , it sure can . but when einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public , she loves to take in the arts .
you like to drink water .
e : tweet , tweet , tweet .
why do we want to protect your home ?
so water was something that scared me to begin with .
and the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said , &quot; i will go a year without any stimulants &quot; -- this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy -- &quot; if you can complete a one kilometer open water race . &quot;
and so his entire body really is underwater .
and i wouldn &apos;t even catch the response . a sad state of affairs .
they were the normal high school curriculum for japanese students -- the other 4,999 students in the school , who were japanese , besides the american .
but no , you &apos;d be wrong because my body is very poorly designed for most things -- pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps .
i got a female instructor first , to teach me the female role , the follow , because i wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities that the follow needed to develop , so i wouldn &apos;t have a repeat of college .
so he uses a lead that focuses on his shoulder girdle and his arm .
tim ferriss : smash fear , learn anything
they found it much more motivational , much more exciting than traditional education .
and i hope that a few of you at least can help us make that happen .
this was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat .
and the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket , puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes -- right here , in his most vulnerable spot -- and he falls down either dead or unconscious , and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head , and the philistines see this and they turn and they just run .
they were incredibly accurate .
why is he being led by the hand by some young boy , presumably , to the point of combat ?
the pituitary tumor , as it grows , often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain , with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted .
that night , i was taken into the emergency room and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis .
and what &apos;s amazing , when you use this technology , for example , looking at humans , we &apos;re not just covered in a sea of microbes .
there are risk factors associated with cesarean sections , some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization when you carve a baby out of its mother rather than being delivered through the birth canal .
now what these transplants , these fecal transplants , or the poo tea suggest to me , and many other people have come up with this same idea , is that the microbial community in and on us , it &apos;s an organ .
but if you know anything about the history of britannica since 1962 , it was anything but radical : still a very completely safe , stodgy type of encyclopedia .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is the new york times website is a huge , enormous corporate operation with -- i have no idea how many hundreds of employees .
they hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality , and we were very pleased with that result .
the reason for this is if we say we &apos;re only going to write the &quot; truth &quot; about some topic , that doesn &apos;t do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write , because i don &apos;t agree with you about what &apos;s the truth .
and we have over 40 irc channels , 40 mailing lists .
the google test is , you look in google and see if it &apos;s there , because if something &apos;s not even in google , it probably doesn &apos;t exist at all .
and i always embarrass her because i say , well , angela , for example , could get away with doing absolutely anything within wikipedia , because she &apos;s so admired and so powerful .
so the final point here is that to understand how wikipedia works , it &apos;s important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work , but we are not fanatical web anarchists . in fact , we &apos;re very flexible about the social methodology , because it &apos;s ultimately the passion of the community is for the quality of the work , not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it .
jimmy wales : the birth of wikipedia
and the second question was , &quot; have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you ? &quot;
so , several years ago , i decided to look into the brain and study this madness .
as the poet terence , the roman poet once said , he said , &quot; the less my hope , the hotter my love . &quot;
it is a homeostatic imbalance .
as a matter of fact , in new york , i often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot .
i think there &apos;s biology to that .
while many people responded in different ways about our education system , my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building .
one : curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow .
did it strike you ?
now the mother you see here is mugsy .
and you can really feel the sound . that was my point with that .
but a second way to crack the code is to develop some technology , an interface to do two-way communication , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been trying to do in the bahamas and in real time .
they could point at the visual object , or they could mimic the whistle .
whoop . almost lost it .
i mean , imagine what it would be like to really understand the mind of another intelligent species on the planet .
so &quot; tembererana &quot; was these dreams , in which i would be running away from bad feelings -- is the only way i can put it .
ladies and gentlemen , an historic flight has begun .
you are just in the element .
for example , last winter i began with kite surfing -- so new things .
so that was one of those cases where you let the wings go , right ?
we have a hundred years of experience .
so it was much safer for me to land at the bottom .
but what normally preoccupied them also involved yearning to know .
what were people now doing for the first time that made that difference between stagnation and rapid , open-ended discovery ?
empiricism is inadequate because , well , scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen .
brains only detect nerve impulses .
what does that mean ? well , explanation is an assertion about what &apos;s there , unseen , that accounts for what &apos;s seen .
no easily implemented change could make that tilt cause the same seasons in both hemispheres .
the problem is , there aren &apos;t enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world .
and they &apos;re in fifteen countries . they &apos;re spread around the world .
what was this place called minto ?
they &apos;re open , these festivals , because , like in minto , they understand that the dialogue between the local and the global is essential .
festivals promote diversity , they bring neighbors into dialogue , they increase creativity , they offer opportunities for civic pride , they improve our general psychological well-being .
&#91; &quot; &apos; a trip to the moon &apos; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; 2011 restoration of the original hand-tinted color &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &apos; 2001 : a space odyssey &apos; &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; academy award winner for visual effects &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; &apos; avatar &apos; &quot; &#93; first doctor : how are you feeling , jake ?
i don &apos;t know why national geographic has done this , they &apos;ve never done this before , but they &apos;re allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that i &apos;ve just completed that is not published yet .
now they &apos;re saying the sea ice in the arctic , the summertime extent is going to be gone in the next four to 10 years .
they &apos;re not going to die of hypothermia .
i can &apos;t feel my lips ; my face is frozen ; i can &apos;t feel my hands ; i can &apos;t feel my feet .
and the cod are there because they are feeding on all the copepods and amphipods .
the boat starts to sink , they race back to the ship and get to go home and tell the stories of how they got attacked .
so i had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but i had such , such dry mouth .
and she would sort of bring them over to me and offer it to me .
and just like the polar bears , these animals depend on an icy environment .
bring them out , check , and see how accurate you were .
that &apos;s why there &apos;s the cocktail effect : when you &apos;re in a party , you &apos;re having conversations with someone , and yet you can recognize your name and you didn &apos;t even realize you were listening to that .
hi , sir , how are you ?
ar : would you be surprised if i could take it out of your hand ? say yes .
oh , that &apos;s where it was . go ahead and put it away .
i was checking mine . i couldn &apos;t find everything , but i noticed you had something here .
and now we &apos;ve got the digital revolution .
ushahidi is not only the software that we made .
&#91; most use technology to define the function . we use function to drive the technology . &#93; what if we could overcome the problem of unreliable internet and electricity and reduce the cost of connection ?
our team has basically been mules carrying components from the u.s. to kenya . we &apos;ve had very interesting conversations with customs border agents .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere , and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities , where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas , but we also have problems that , when we lose power , we can &apos;t open a window here , and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again .
and so you can imagine , even in this application , that in a high-rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to 30 , 40 floors , the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface .
if you know about this trait , you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior .
we think they must be blinded by religion , or by simple stupidity .
the first one is harm / care .
food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays , and a lot of it is ideas about purity , about what you &apos;re willing to touch , or put into your body .
i &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
but the &apos; 60s inevitably gives way to the &apos; 70s , where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more .
i think that &apos;s probably right , although this is a controversial issue .
if you &apos;re high in openness to experience , revolution is good , it &apos;s change , it &apos;s fun .
but before you feel superior to george bush , before you throw a stone , ask yourself , do you accept this ?
jonathan haidt : the moral roots of liberals and conservatives
situation &apos;s a little bit different where perhaps they know someone who &apos;s hostile , where they &apos;ve got someone shooting at them or doing something else that &apos;s clearly hostile , throwing rocks , whatever .
and since we &apos;ve already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways , i thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try to relate it to the military context .
so it wasn &apos;t that queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on .
and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anesthetic gas .
and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer .
so why is this relevant ?
and this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size .
people are remaking things into fashion .
they &apos;re not mainstream .
he liked to take things apart .
so you figure out how to program this , and you put this in your mailbox .
in fact , these guys actually work for nasa , and they &apos;re trying to pioneer using off-the-shelf components , cheap things that aren &apos;t specialized that they can combine and send up into space .
this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it &apos;s all about sex tips .
and there &apos;s something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history . when the witches cast a magic spell on you , it was not in your self-interest -- it was to get you to act against your interest .
what glamour is all about -- i took this from a blurb in the table of contents of new york magazine , which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about transcending the everyday .
and this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous .
&quot; to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort &quot; : and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour .
it has that sense of going up and away , and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were -- particularly going down .
&quot; the matrix &quot; is a movie that is all about glamour .
and here &apos;s hedy lamarr .
for years , i actually only wore hats .
if i was tired , i drank more espressos .
and i heard stories that shattered all the other stories .
i know that everything is connected , and the scar that runs the length of my torso is the markings of the earthquake .
it was the greed and recklessness that led to the drilling explosion .
it was energy , love and joy .
and to try to understand how you can put together simple units , simple messages over space and time , in a network , and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds .
rs : yeah . so ivan has this cheese sandwich , and he says , &quot; yum yum yum yum yum !
now i &apos;m going to show you a three-year-old who got the same puzzle .
and so , it is not until age seven that we get what looks more like an adult response .
and we can compare that to another case , where everything in the real world is the same .
so there is no physical force , just a magnetic pulse .
i mean , you &apos;re clearly an incredible human being , but someone could take this knowledge and in some future not-torture chamber , do acts that people here might be worried about .
rs : i hope they do . and i think they probably won &apos;t .
but there &apos;s a very serious point , and i think that in the headlong dash of daily life , we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us .
now , if you think about how our world got so accelerated , the usual suspects rear their heads .
they want to get back to slower rhythms .
now , clearly there are problems with the 35-hour workweek in france -- too much , too soon , too rigid .
one is that speed is fun , you know , speed is sexy .
and what that means is that i no longer overload myself gratuitously .
journalist carl honore believes the western world &apos;s emphasis on speed erodes health , productivity and quality of life . but there &apos;s a backlash brewing , as everyday people start putting the brakes on their all-too-modern lives .
and out of this idea started spinning off many , many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities , and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits , and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry .
he is on a state visit . we took him on a visit to yad vashem , we took him to the children &apos;s memorial ; he was extremely moved .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s rebuild the museum . &quot;
and what i felt about that building is that it really was a building that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote kundera -- that it had to do with whiteness , it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism .
i won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
see , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
we know that to be able to come on the bandstand and play music is a blessing .
stefon harris : there are no mistakes on the bandstand
or can you move beyond my veil and see me for who i truly am inside ?
i just really wanted to acknowledge you .
hot air rises , and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it .
so it &apos;s essentially a freshwater animal .
i didn &apos;t know at the time , but i know now , they &apos;re globe skimmers , hundreds of them .
i got a little bit curious . in fact i &apos;ll stop here , because i want to ask , and there is a lot of people who , from india of course , people who grew up spending your childhood here .
so , next thing i did is i got on the phone .
october , november , december . that is not the northeast monsoon season .
and i know because when you look at the rainfall , these particular insects , these globe skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools .
here , here , kenya , east africa , they &apos;ve actually just come out of a long drought .
and this crossing here , of the ocean , is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing of any insect .
and down here , and they winter down here &#91; in southern africa &#93; .
charles anderson : dragonflies that fly across oceans
you have a signature board and wheels and shoes and clothes . i had all that stuff , and it &apos;s gone .
it is the funnest trick ever to do .
freestyle oriented , manual down -- wheelie down .
but it is quite similar . i mean , what is it to hack , right ?
it &apos;s peer respect that drives us . that &apos;s the one thing that makes us do what we do . i &apos;ve had over a dozen bones , these guys , this guy , over , what , eight , 10 concussions , to the point where it &apos;s comedy , right ?
i last did a tedtalk i think about seven years ago or so .
and all sorts of people , moving up to the first world war and between the wars , tried to solve this problem , and nearly everybody came up short .
and what did the norden bombsight do ?
there are clouds , right .
but we need to be very clear about how little that means .
that is one of the most extraordinary records in the history of modern warfare .
jackson browne plays a song he started writing last april aboard mission blue voyage , the sylvia earle-inspired trip to brainstorm ways to save the ocean . &quot; if i could be anywhere , &quot; he sings , &quot; anywhere right now , i would be here . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
bumped into eurasia around 16 million years ago , and then we had the first african exodus , as we call it .
and he did a pretty good job .
how long is it ? well , it &apos;s billions of these subunits in length .
well , the thing that jumps out at you first is that the deepest lineages in our family trees are found within africa , among africans .
new york city , chicago , seattle , all under a sheet of ice .
the population size started to expand .
and i said , &quot; well , you know , what i &apos;ve sketched out here is just that .
the most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public ; 210,000 people have ordered these participation kits since we launched two years ago , which has raised around five million dollars , the majority of which , at least half , is going back into the legacy fund .
and they &apos;re being traded by a species of almost seven billion individuals , who are linked by trade , travel , and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity .
it contains everything that &apos;s in today &apos;s universe , so you can imagine , it &apos;s busting .
from about 200 million years after the big bang , stars begin to appear all through the universe , billions of them .
in intergalactic space , there &apos;s so little energy that atoms can &apos;t combine .
notice that information has become part of our story .
the sad thing is , when they die , the information dies with them .
and it &apos;s a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role .
a lot of people buy the biggest house they can afford , and actually slightly bigger than that .
no one .
two thirds are not saving now .
it &apos;s only a problem now when the chocolate is next to us .
doing nothing is very common .
we hate losing stuff , even if it doesn &apos;t mean a lot of risk .
next january comes and people might feel that if they save more , they have to spend less , and that &apos;s painful .
this is really the tip of the iceberg .
john , do you want to introduce the song ?
and i think we have a caller coming in here .
of nations ! &quot;
and how many of you did not get that ?
so what do you do ?
so i said , &quot; please measure forever because in school they &apos;re teaching me that if i cannot measure it , it does not exist .
alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him , and he went out to conquer the world .
so , the sequel to &quot; elizabeth , &quot; &quot; golden age . &quot;
remember , in the film , to me , both her and her lady in waiting were parts of the same body , one the mortal self and one the spirit self .
raleigh : majesty .
so the film is operating on many many levels in that scene .
so the design has a story .
harmony is the suggestion of something that is embracing and universal and of eternity and of the moment .
it &apos;s not the work i set out to do .
and the people who made money from brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests .
if we were farmers , we &apos;d be eating our seed .
we can get efficiency up .
how is a consumer going to walk through this minefield ?
let &apos;s see , that &apos;s about 7,000 languages , 350 major languages -- a lot of work there .
we can &apos;t wait that long .
now what we &apos;re doing is bringing the ceos of these 80 companies together to help twist the arms of the final 20 , to bring them to the table , because they don &apos;t like ngos , they &apos;ve never worked with ngos , they &apos;re concerned about this , they &apos;re concerned about that , but we all need to be in this together .
what they &apos;ve realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance , they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa on 40 percent of the land .
jason clay : how big brands can help save biodiversity
he listened to me carefully , and responded with a grin .
with this in mind , we developed a completely new robotic system to support the rat in any direction of space .
we did not aim to repair the spinal cord , yet we were able to promote one of the more extensive remodeling of axonal projections ever observed in the central nervous system of adult mammal after an injury .
thank you .
he just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder .
we all know .
i never cut class . sorry , i don &apos;t know if anybody is cutting class .
because we are counting on you .
she said , &quot; please , sing for me . &quot;
no other way dans l &apos;espace , so help to have the fruits
but they had an amazing freedom , which was they didn &apos;t have to make any money from it .
so the internet needs addressing and directions .
one of the most popular websites in the world , run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube or google were particularly privileged to do about it .
and then it turns out the back room grew to encompass the entire project .
so what we see -- what we see in this phenomenon is something that the crazed , late traffic engineer hans monderman discovered in the netherlands , and here in south kensington , that sometimes if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else , you can actually end up with a safer environment in which people can function , and one in which they are more human with each other .
you send in a picture of your cat if it looks like hitler .

jonathan zittrain : the web as random acts of kindness
in our latest assessment in 2009 , we measured 74 school systems that together cover 87 percent of the economy .
and i &apos;m making the size of the bubble proportional to the amount of money that countries spent on students .
and the bitter truth really is that , you know , not in many countries .
and even those people who complain and say that the relative standing of countries on something like pisa is just an artifact of culture , of economic factors , of social issues , of homogeneity of societies , and so on , these people must now concede that education improvement is possible .
nine out of 10 japanese students say that it depends on my own investment , on my own effort , and that tells you a lot about the system that is around them .
and the most impressive outcomes of world-class systems is that they achieve high performance across the entire system .
we all live in the same planet , but there &apos;s still a great deal of poverty in the world .
and that is the perspective i have , and then i can start my story .
and after all , poor countries , like rich countries , one thing we &apos;ve got equal , is their days are the same length : 24 hours .
so the question was , i started looking at this issue , and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york .
and they had these branches .
even in bangladesh , there are some empty places .
i &apos;ve been very surprised .
and the fact was that indian students studied harder than we did in sweden .
1858 was the year when the courageous uprising against the foreign occupation of india was defeated by the british forces .
india was trying down here .
children started to go to school .
but on the other hand , guizhou , one of the poorest inland provinces of china , is there .
now , back to my projections .
can you see here what japan did ?
hans rosling was a young guest student in india when he first realized that asia had all the capacities to reclaim its place as the world &apos;s dominant economic force . at tedindia , he graphs global economic growth since 1858 and predicts the exact date that india and china will outstrip the us .
when those measurements are made , instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant , as a function of distance .
how do we see that galaxy ?
now , you can do an experiment tonight over the reception , ok , to figure out what that image will look like .
so what we can do , then , is based on how much distortion we see in those images , we can calculate how much mass there must be in this cluster .
so a little over a decade ago , two groups of physicists and astronomers set out to measure the rate at which the expansion of space was slowing down , ok .
so , this is exactly what you want in physics : where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory that was actually developed for something else .
we &apos;re so excited to be here . it &apos;s such an honor for us .
the reuse of syringes now exceeds that and kills 1.3 million people a year .
the toy seller , in this case , had syringes , which they usually do , next door to the diggers , which is obviously what you would expect .
and this is a pretty well-educated audience , so i imagine you all know something about aids .
so if we look in this particularly high-risk sample , they &apos;re being asked , &quot; did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months ? &quot;
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , in addition to a lot of children .
in uganda we see the prevalence went down .
that suggests it &apos;s pretty similar levels of development .
but openness and inter-connectedness , it comes with a cost when we think about disease . i don &apos;t think this should be a surprise .
there was a big decline in coffee prices .
emily oster : flip your thinking on aids in africa
and most people knock them down when they &apos;re small .
they &apos;re the people who make the bullet train .
it has no fresh water that it &apos;s able to drink , but it drinks water out of fog .
there are many many ways that nature filters water that takes salt out of water .
loose nanoparticles . what is really interesting to me is that not many people have been asking , &quot; how can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe ? &quot;
mit just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips .
and up will come mangroves , and sea turtles and your own kidneys .
like a wide-eyed kid , i &apos;d say , &quot; why is that ? &quot;
i &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
out of 100 , 90 are your creation .
and i redefined policing concepts in india .
and i said , &quot; do you pray ? &quot; when i looked at the group , i said , &quot; do you pray ? &quot;
now if i &apos;d not done that , it would have been a hellhole .
this is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison .
the random characters that happened to be shown to the user were w , a , i , t , which , of course , spell a word .
another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a captcha they solve a little bit of this problem ?
and if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
i &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
so this is the project . here &apos;s how it started .
it was somebody who was trying to ask a question about javascript .
now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
now the thing that i &apos;m most excited about with duolingo is i think this provides a fair business model for language education .
now , a decade later , it &apos;s really time to push the envelope a little bit , and so a couple years ago i moved to paris with my husband and youngest child , and we launched buzzcar a year ago .
seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years , what people would do for five dollars .
the cars are completely insured during the rental , and it gives drivers what they need , and what do they need ?
back to this spectrum .
it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
you &apos;ve probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present . &quot; be here now , &quot; you &apos;ve probably heard a hundred times .
in contrast , there &apos;s no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later .
the firing squad aimed , fired -- the general was dead .
now in 1957 , ghana was the first sub-saharan country to gain its independence .
here is another proof that the african is not capable of governing himself .
the belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep , proving that the african is capable of governing himself .
but it didn &apos;t -- it never occurred to me that it had to be invented and that it had been invented only 350 years ago .
and the religious people said that if god wanted you to make -- i mean , god is everywhere , that was one of their rules , is god is everywhere .
so they were -- the really important part of this was , you were not supposed to talk about final causes , for instance .
it &apos;s been so cool since then .
i didn &apos;t take it personally , but -- i just -- i had -- i naively had thought , until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century , i &apos;d thought that &apos;s just the way people thought , and everybody did , and they recognized reality by what they could see or touch or feel or hear .
just to see what would happen , if you mixed it together .
at any rate , i bring it up because it &apos;s a good story , and he said , tell personal things , you know , and that &apos;s a personal -- i was going to tell you about the first night that i met my wife , but that would be too personal , wouldn &apos;t it .
they made bigger guns to shoot them down with .
he was thinking of the earth as , kind of like , you know , like a completely insulated thing with no stuff in it , really , just energy coming down , energy leaving .
so the theory &apos;s kaput -- it &apos;s nothing .
and the way to it , for me , was through artistic means .
the nature had really reclaimed the whole complex .
i was really frightened at first , but i calmly explained to him that i was working on an art project and he didn &apos;t seem to mind and so i went ahead and put my camera on self-timer and ran back and forth .
there are more than 185 miles of tunnels , and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum .
i &apos;ve become more interested in capturing movement and texture .
the third question is , why is it hotter in summer than in winter ?
and we intercut it with , &quot; we are the premier science university in the world , &quot; because of british-like hubris .
right ? that would explain it , right ?
and the exploratorium does that really , really well .
finally , my plea to you is to allow yourselves , and your children , and anyone you know , to kind of fiddle with stuff , because it &apos;s by fiddling with things that you , you know , you complement your other learning . it &apos;s not a replacement , it &apos;s just part of learning that &apos;s important .
and this seems quite a profound question .
in fact , we were the only people in the universe .
chemists are trying to study the molecules to look at disease .
you can decode the genome , you can look back , you can link us all together by a mitochondrial dna , but we can &apos;t get further than the last ancestor , the last visible cell that we could sequence or think back in history .
i say , &quot; well i want molecules . &quot;
and that is the key .
and the profound realization for me is that , if this works , the concept of the selfish gene gets kicked up a level , and we really start talking about selfish matter .
in your own mind , what do you believe the chances are that walking around on some other planet is non-carbon-based life , walking or oozing or something ?
come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
this was 1977 , 1988 , 1992 , &apos; 97 and 2002 .
they have 2.4 percent .
but even this is not a fair representation of africa , because it &apos;s an average , it &apos;s an average speed of reduction in africa .
and then , you see , these were famine years .
and the good thing is that ghana today is going with the same rate as egypt did at its fastest .
welcome to a decent life .
it &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
well , you are to ride a bicycle , carrying your own weight and also some other weight , so that you can earn the bread for the day .
and it was that compassion which bothered them , because when he saw -- in fact , he told me about eight or nine years ago how he was driving his own car -- he drives his own car by the way -- and he saw in the rain , a family like the one that i showed to you getting drenched with an infant .
and the nano team average age was just 27 years .
volkswagon was 11,333 .
more importantly , they not only walk far to work , and not only do they cycle to work , but they cycle for work , as you can see here .
i &apos;ve been talking about getting more from less for more .
looks absolutely audacious .
it &apos;s about ultra-low cost .
that &apos;s the new world that we want to create .
but then he held it for a little while , lakshmi .
engineer ra mashelkar shares three stories of ultra-low-cost design from india that use bottom-up rethinking , and some clever engineering , to bring expensive products into the realm of the possible for everyone .
i &apos;m fortunate enough to be part of one .
and i thought , you know , is this the best way to do it ?
so going back to what i was saying before about all power being produced -- well , other than photovoltaic -- being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine , that &apos;s actually not that efficient , and in fact , in a nuclear power plant like this , it &apos;s only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient .
and this is really important , because the reaction stops .
and people say , &quot; oh , well , you &apos;ve launched this thing , and it &apos;s radioactive , into space , and what about accidents ? &quot;
now , there &apos;s an antidote to commoditization , and that is customization .
you like your fantasy environments , your fake , your disneyland experiences .
that has -- the whole quality movement has risen with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years .
all right , now , there is value for fake .
think about disney again .
but surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a starbucks , with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there , and now , because of that authentic experience , you can charge two , three , four , five dollars for a cup of coffee .
and this really came about from having many different kinds of interests .
and because the wishbone is bone -- it &apos;s animal -- it &apos;s sort of a point where i think we can enter into it .
and then , i got a call from a friend who wanted to have a show of erotic art , and i didn &apos;t have any pieces .
but then in the end , what i decided was every time you finish writing the word , i would stop and i would give the card to somebody on the side of the road .
one of the fascinating things about what we were actually working on is that we were seeing , using new kinds of scanning technologies , things that had just never been seen before -- i mean , not only in disease management , but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel .
and as we kept on working on this data , looking at small clusters of the body , these little pieces of tissue that were a trophoblast coming off of a blastocyst , all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus , saying , &quot; i &apos;m here to stay . &quot;
and it &apos;s not just our own existence , but how does the woman &apos;s body understand but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological , cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture , treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond , again , our comprehension -- the magic that is existence , that is us ?
so i invested more than eight months just studying the profile of this star .
a star is the most simple object .
it was incredible . the only conclusion we could make from this is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion in this system , which polluted the atmosphere of this star .
and if you find one , i will say that this is something related to seti , because naturally you can &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s exactly the same game . a very tiny feature .
if you see , in the spectrum of a planet host star , if you see strange chemical elements , it can be a signal from a civilization which is there and they want to signal about it .
so , i &apos;ll start with this : a couple years ago , an event planner called me because i was going to do a speaking event .
i was like , &quot; really ? &quot; and he was like , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
and it turned out to be shame .
they believe they &apos;re worthy .
they talked about the willingness to say , &quot; i love you &quot; first , the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees , the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram .
and this is a therapist who sees therapists , because we have to go to those , because their b.s. meters are good .
why do we struggle with it so much ?
you cannot selectively numb .
let me tell you what we think about children .
brené brown studies human connection -- our ability to empathize , belong , love . in a poignant , funny talk , she shares a deep insight from her research , one that sent her on a personal quest to know herself as well as to understand humanity . a talk to share . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
so , if we want to act more effectively in the world , we have to get to know ourselves better .
but it &apos;s a story until we convert it to data and so what we do , this concept we had , was to take steven &apos;s status , &quot; what is my status ? &quot;
here is an m.s. patient .
and i want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing it for more than two years .
i want to solve a problem . i want an application .
because the blue line is a better line . the red line is way downhill , the blue line is a good line .
this is not just graphics .
can we do the even harder thing ? can we go to the patients that actually decided to stay on lithium , because they were so convinced they were getting better ?
first time we ever tried it . we &apos;ll try to get it better later but 12 months so far .
i &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s nothing normal about this .
carbon at the nanoscale is actually transparent and flexible .
knowing that we &apos;re not going to put fifty of these in our basements to store our power , we went to a group at university of texas at dallas , and we gave them this diagram .
it &apos;s a picture of a little girl dying of thirst .
what &apos;s happening here ? how can this be possible ?
so the whole is literally more than the sum of its parts .
and what is the overall distribution of control ?
about 10 years ago , mr. tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company , which had ownership and control in a bigger company .
it &apos;s not a street map . &quot;
there &apos;s even a software called cadnano that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes like nano robots or drug delivery systems and use dna to self-assemble those functional structures .
and when i throw this up into the air and catch it , it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein , all of the intricacies .
and this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior and try to optimize which parts are folding when .
this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own .
no human lands on all fours like that .
scientists change the answer to &quot; how fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t expect to get in , and my family had no money for college .
tuesday night it &apos;s school violence and bullying .
in fact , what we &apos;ve found is that every single business outcome improves .
even a mobile phone , it &apos;s a computer .
bad blocks . but anyways , the tofu to me was kind of my origin , basically .
after that , things kind of got strange , and i got thinking about the computer , because the computer to me always , kind of , bothered me .
it &apos;s not like print . it &apos;s not like video .
and this computer &apos;s programmed to do only one thing , which is , if you move your mouse , the mouse changes on the screen .
and i &apos;ll never forget how , like , but -- i &apos;ll never forget how , like , he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm .
i made -- i took my old macintoshes and made different objects out of them from tokyo .
so , this is , like , in front of the eiffel tower , really , actually , around the louvre area .
and there risd appeared .
so the point here is that not all boys exist within these rigid boundaries of what we think of as boys and girls , and not all girls exist within those rigid boundaries of what we think of as girls .
guess what ?
i want to write about this really interesting world .
third reason that boys are out of sync with school today : kindergarten is the old second grade , folks .
we can design better games .
it &apos;s very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to lead us .
the bubble would then expand at the speed of light , invading all space , and turning the higgs field from the familiar state into a new state .
theoretical physicists always ask &quot; why &quot; questions .
the biggest surprise of discovering the higgs boson ? that there were no surprises . gian giudice talks us through a problem in theoretical physics : what if the higgs field exists in an ultra-dense state that could mean the collapse of all atomic matter ? with wit and charm , giudice outlines a grim fate -- and why we shouldn &apos;t start worrying just yet .
we &apos;d put them in an environment where they didn &apos;t want to be , and they didn &apos;t want to do what we wanted them to do .
and it &apos;s pretty simple , really .
so this is the bit i &apos;m really scared of .
it &apos;s just about , i want to create some great experiences .
you may never experience the entire thing yourself .
and there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success .
for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground , this may be counter-intuitive , but driving has potholes , cobblestones , pedestrians , other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with .
amd : see , we &apos;re all exceedingly excited about that little bunny hop .
and mobility to your destination is clearly solved .
now , you &apos;ll still have about three billion pounds left in change , and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down .
there are even records of people being executed for refusing to grow potatoes .
so , the bizarre thing , which is baffling to conventional , classically trained economists , is that a weird little smiley face has a better effect on changing your behavior than the threat of a £ 60 fine and three penalty points .
now , we basically have to change our views slightly .
every country has a contextual alcoholic drink . in france it &apos;s pernod .
have any of these diamond shapes gone out ?
but this is both hysterically funny -- but i think an important philosophical point , which is , going forward , we need more of this kind of value .
i was spending all my time practicing .
we humans are earth &apos;s pandoran species .
and if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring whatever it was that helped them survive , then those offspring must be better adapted to the circumstances in which all this happened than their parents were .
darwin didn &apos;t , of course ; he didn &apos;t know about genes .
but a lot of these problems can be avoided by remembering the definition .
audience : bathroom soap .
there are two replicators now on this planet .
we put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet , but in order to get true temes and true teme machines , you need to get the variation , the selection and the copying , all done outside of humans .
just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy .
the genes are forced into producing all this myelin , all the fat to myelinate the brain .
one that is obviously happening all around us now , is that the temes turn us into teme machines , with these implants , with the drugs , with us merging with the technology .
my wife sent me a message , &quot; whoa , earthquake , &quot; and then disappeared for 25 minutes .
andre told me , after seeing these buildings fail again and again in the same way , that there is no new research here .
and the fellow in the vest there , craig toten , he has pushed forward to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this .
they told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn &apos;t mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
and it turns out it &apos;s a more general case -- there &apos;s a lot of mistakes we do .
for some people , we varied how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could steal .
in fact , even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the bible and we give them a chance to cheat , they don &apos;t cheat at all .
i &apos;ll tell you what i think about this and the stock market in a minute .
and at pittsburgh there are two big universities , carnegie mellon and university of pittsburgh .
i think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
so if i was to ask you what the connection between a bottle of tide detergent and sweat was , you &apos;d probably think that &apos;s the easiest question that you &apos;re going to be asked in edinburgh all week .
and you can see here some photographs from london where barclays sponsored the city bike scheme , and some activists have done some nice piece of guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans .
so admittedly it &apos;s a currency at the moment that &apos;s purely for the kindle .
so this currency becomes credit , which again , is really , really interesting .
and my job is to look at lots of different species of animals and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work when everything &apos;s going right , rather than trying to figure out how to fix things when they go wrong , like so many of you .
most of the time it &apos;s a flexible organ .
and this was the point at which my graduate adviser said , &quot; whoa ! hold on . slow down . &quot;
and one thing kept bothering me , and that &apos;s , when they &apos;re functioning , penises don &apos;t wiggle .
i really believe that we still have a lot to learn about the normal structure and function of our bodies .
so i asked natalie , what do i do ?
then we dated for two years , broke up for 10 , got back together and got married .
dl : how fast ?
sorry , i hate to carry on ...
so i &apos;d like to share with you a story about a self-study , self-empowering computer science course that i built , together with my brilliant colleague noam nisan .
and parag shah , another engineer , from mumbai , has unbundled our projects into smaller , more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program .
well , in my opinion , we went too far with this nonsense , and grading became degrading .
now , i don &apos;t know how many people here are familiar with the term &quot; mensch . &quot;
it is so powerful that we only need tiny amounts .
it is time to be asking questions about technology .
your mobile phone , computer and game console have a bloody past — tied to tantalum mining , which funds the war in the democratic republic of the congo . drawing on his personal story , activist and refugee bandi mbubi gives a stirring call to action .
and they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking .
and the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all .
and i think i can see a few eyes rolling .
so , taxi journeys might be one example .
this is a world of atomized capitalism .
so a few of the stories .
coal-powered industrial revolution in this country -- oil , gas , sorry .
so , uranium , which is very big , wants to split .
and you make if from lithium . that reaction at the bottom , that &apos;s lithium 6 , plus a neutron , will give you more helium , plus tritium .
and in fact we can make fusion happen .
but we can &apos;t abandon it now ; we have to push forward , get fusion to happen .
in fact , it attracted accolades from multinational organizations because of its economic growth .
if , however , the core issues that propelled the revolution aren &apos;t addressed , the consequences could be catastrophic -- not just for egypt , but for the entire region .
now i know what some of you are thinking .
what drives men &apos;s support for women &apos;s employment is men &apos;s employment , their level of education as well as a high score on their country &apos;s u.n. human development index .
we &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
but the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
nancy lublin : texting that saves lives
one year later , the next declarations of impossibilities began .
we call it rocketcam .
in 2008 , it flew for a whopping 20 seconds , a year later , two minutes , then six , eventually 11 .
today we are making metals that are lighter than styrofoam , so light they can sit atop a dandelion puff and be blown away with a wisp of air -- so light that you can make a car that two people can lift , but so strong that it has the crash-worthiness of an suv .
the internet is home to two billion people , or 30 percent of the world &apos;s population .
i guess in some way , i sort of believe it &apos;s supposed to be hard .
rd : yeah , yeah . it did .
and you have to revisit these questions over time .
my job is one of the most exhilarating jobs you could have .
there is no way back home .
and i &apos;ve been riding with these kids once a week , every tuesday , rain or shine , for the last four years and by now , they &apos;ve become a very big part of my life .
and i &apos;m just standing there , watching this scene with a complete disbelief , not knowing what to do .
he &apos;s a 17-year-old .
you know , perspective is one of these critically important life-coping strategies that mountain biking can really teach you .
and only now , &quot; he says , &quot; i &apos;m beginning to understand where i am , and i actually like it . &quot;
it &apos;s no longer valid or real .
and it is important .
dr. phyllis lee gave me my interview , and she asked me , &quot; how would you define race ? &quot;
but there is something that can give the self ultimate and infinite connection -- and that thing is oneness , our essence .
and over time and with practice , i &apos;ve tried to live more and more from my essence .
and there on the smaller scale , the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument , was a materiality and a soulfulness .
the brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
and instead , we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us .
there &apos;s 250 pavilions .
so we were trying to think , how could we make a whole thing emanate .
and i just wanted to show you .
and that &apos;s my final slide .
there are also , i think , increasing results from the scientific study of humans that , indeed , we &apos;re not born blank slates .
the foremost is that if we &apos;re blank slates , then , by definition , we are equal , because zero equals zero equals zero .
it &apos;s not clear , by the way , since then , whether that is an accurate generalization , but the data at the time seemed to support that .
there are , of course , entirely new art forms and new media , many of which you &apos;ve heard over these few days .
by the way , this is one sentence -- you can actually parse it .
that would make them super-similar , right ?
but , this is a touchy subject , and i work for the discovery channel , and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do , and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals .
albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
and he says , &quot; like the humane society ? &quot;
i go in , i grab the scrotum , tip comes off .
literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis .
you &apos;ve had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years , right ? &quot;
he &apos;s making a great living .
so , i &apos;m 40 feet off the deck , which is like looking down at the top of your shoe , you know , and it &apos;s doing this in the ocean .
if there &apos;s a plumber , he &apos;s 300 pounds and he &apos;s got a giant butt crack . admit it .
and to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with , is that fact that i got it wrong about a lot of things , not just the testicles on my chin .
i &apos;ve got nightmare disorder , which is categorized if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure -- and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street going , &quot; you &apos;re a failure . &quot;
he beat someone up or something , and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence .
and i was in prison awaiting trial , and my cellmate said to me , &apos; you know what you have to do ?
how do you cross your legs in a sane way ?
he was a psychopath .
and i emailed him and i said , &quot; i believe you may have a very special brain anomaly that makes you special and interested in the predatory spirit and fearless .
can i go through them with you ? &quot;
and the gems are always the outermost aspects of our interviewee &apos;s personality .
but she &apos;s married , so i &apos;m going to have to get her split up from her husband . &quot;
now , consider religion -- in this case islam , which is the religion that , in some direct sense , can be said to be precipitating what we &apos;re about to enter .
and the same problem with respect to islam .
what i want to suggest to you , though , in the next couple of minutes is that there &apos;s also a hopeful response to this .
they were actually blocked from even forming a party under the political system there . why ?
well , what i &apos;m here to say then is , for people who are skeptical about the war , it &apos;s especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war there is a possibility for the government of the united states and the muslim peoples with whom it interacts to create real forms of government that are truly democratic and also truly islamic .
and the local seabird rescue center , named sanccob , immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken .
personally , i really didn &apos;t know if i was capable of handling such a monstrous task .
and we used this technique again during the treasure rescue .
and this is critically important because , one year ago , the african penguin was declared endangered .
we call it propaganda gardening .
and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start , and most importantly of all , we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say , &quot; these small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow &apos;s problems , &quot; because i have seen the power of small actions , and it is awesome .
we &apos;ve created a company . we are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school , like you do , and now we &apos;re going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees , and the kids are helping us build that , and the kids are on the board , and because the community was really keen on working with the high school , the high school is now teaching agriculture , and because it &apos;s teaching agriculture , we started to think , how could we then get those kids that never had a qualification before in their lives but are really excited about growing , how can we give them some more experience ?
more than 30 towns in england now are spinning the incredible edible plate .
and i &apos;m intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today .
in the quran , religious opinion -- religious orthodoxy -- is dismissed as &quot; zanna : &quot; self-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other , but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian .
scripture , he says , &quot; teaches nothing but charity , and we must not leave an interpretation of scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it . &quot;
and my hosts in pakistan said , &quot; look , don &apos;t be too polite to us .
that is the ethos found , too , in all the religions .
so that &apos;s just the eye of the bee with a microscope , and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia , and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they &apos;re right up close to something , because they can &apos;t see in stereo .
the petal of that flower looks like that , so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects , and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here , this is the style of that flower , and you notice that it &apos;s got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things that are what are called spurs . these are nectar spurs .
so when i first looked at this , i was -- i thought , gee , this is like a little treasure trove here .
look at this hole in the middle . that hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the moon .
and i do really like this shot , because it shows all the detritus that &apos;s sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers .
and i &apos;m sure ross can associate that with design .
so , still working with film , i &apos;m afraid .
but people do donate their bodies to art and science .
the lorry goes in front of it . and it takes slices of x-rays through the lorry .
if you look at this , just the tube , it is quite bright .
and i had a mac classic . and it &apos;s a little box .
that &apos;s what i do .
your consciousness , the you-ness of you , the me-ness of me -- that gets this one go .
i &apos;m very lucky , because he &apos;s better than all the other children .
i &apos;m sitting on a train .
does science ruin the magic of life ? in this grumpy but charming monologue , robin ince makes the argument against . the more we learn about the astonishing behavior of the universe -- the more we stand in awe .
maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
it is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
and then life was fine , dandy .
and everything i saw in the cultivation said there were huge fights amongst the foodies between the cultivators and the hunter-gatherers .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
well , he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president abacha , and it just so happens he &apos;s a convicted money launderer too .
he did business with global banks .
a recent study by the world bank looked at 200 cases of corruption .
after many months of digging around and reading through hundreds of pages of court documents , we found evidence that , in fact , shell and eni had known that the funds would be transferred to that shell company , and frankly , it &apos;s hard to believe they didn &apos;t know who they were really dealing with there .
i &apos;m very worried today about this notion , this world , this prevailing kind of force of security .
you must fight anyone who encroaches upon it .
one of the amazing things that i &apos;ve discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species .
there &apos;s a young woman named carrie rethlefsen in minnesota .
real security is contemplating death , not pretending it doesn &apos;t exist .
when i start to pretend that what i &apos;m seeing isn &apos;t impacting me , and isn &apos;t changing my heart , then i get in trouble .
but upon arrival there , in the fall of 1986 , and doing a lot of interviews , i found that the only thing i was offered was to be assistant to the art director at alfred a. knopf , a book publisher .
so there you are .
but whoever it is , i can &apos;t help but thinking they woke up one day like , &quot; oh my god , that wasn &apos;t there last night . ooooohh !
the answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
don &apos;t get me started .
we &apos;re talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling , and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a german shepherd to explode .
kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking .
now , what &apos;s even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities .
no , really , we are going to be the next generation , the ones who will bring this world forward .
well , i was wrong . what i learned from these encounters was that careful listening gives us incredibly valuable tools by which to evaluate the health of a habitat across the entire spectrum of life .
but here &apos;s a picture of lincoln meadow taken after , and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye , hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place , which would confirm the logging company &apos;s contention that there &apos;s nothing of environmental impact .
horrified , my colleagues remained behind to gather his thoughts and to record whatever he could the rest of the afternoon , and that evening , he captured a remarkable event : the lone surviving male beaver swimming in slow circles crying out inconsolably for its lost mate and offspring .
they forced us to learn things like latin .
you had to have an even better imagination to play this game , &quot; death rider . &quot;
43 percent of gamers are female .
it &apos;s like that guy obviously had some pain while making it .
you need to be really an incredible artist .
it is because i have had life-altering experiences in virtual space , and video games had begun to erode my own understanding of what is real and what is not .
i know what i want and i do it .
video games are fun , engaging , and leave your brain completely vulnerable to re-programming .
the same with students or highly creative people , writers and people like that .
where better to challenge those minds than here at ted ?
and what that means : &quot; simple and understandable &quot; might not be actually simple or understandable , and things we think are &quot; complex &quot; might be made simple and understandable .
so , another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle .
no matter what the shapes were , the growth law is the same .
and we can reflect here the way gillian ishijima did .
so what i &apos;m doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fifth of a second later , like that . and they &apos;re getting faster and faster each time , and if i stack these guys up , then we see the differences ; the increase in the speed is constant .
with all the intensity and brilliance for which he is known , alan kay envisions better techniques for teaching kids by using computers to illustrate experience in ways - – mathematically and scientifically -- that only computers can .
this is where it &apos;s really central to our lives .
it &apos;s going to probably change the human lifespan .
it &apos;s too risk-averse .
that &apos;s the focus of my book &quot; redesigning humans , &quot; where i talk about the kinds of choices we &apos;ll make , and the challenges it &apos;s going to present to society .
but when something is feasible in thousands of laboratories all over the world , which is going to be the case with these technologies , when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial , which is already the case , and when they &apos;re almost impossible to police , it &apos;s not a question of if this is going to happen , it &apos;s when and where and how it &apos;s going to happen .
this is the flowering of human endeavor . &quot;
where there is this bloody , awful mess happens .
thank you .
and we lay our eggs there , we don &apos;t have to worry about other eggs or anything like that .
like , how do they know that &apos;s the time ?
so we put in dogs mating , and , you know , we &apos;re watching it , and she &apos;s totally absorbed .
the only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength .
every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
this is a list of the core team .
research and ethics committee : if you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and ethics .
they don &apos;t want to change .
you can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have .
yeah well , you guys are making my life miserable because track pads used to be round , a nice round shape .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
they wanted to stir up controversy .
there was an ethnic side to this conflict as very often in africa .
i mean , they didn &apos;t agree with each other -- that was not the point .
and for dictators all over the world , the good news is when cartoonists , journalists and activists shut up .
so , in 2000 we wrote &quot; rare earth . &quot; in 2003 , we then asked , let &apos;s not think about where earths are in space , but how long has earth been earth ?
well , we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what &apos;s going to happen to our particular planet .
the chalk itself &apos;s composed by plankton which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor , so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff , and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer , and then you have black rock .
you know , you &apos;re gazing upon your very distant ancestors .
warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time .
and we know who was there . at the end of the permian , at many of these mass extinction boundaries , this is what we find : isorenieratene . it &apos;s very specific .
and i throw this slide in -- this is me , actually , two months ago -- and i throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal , chambered nautilus .
six hours later , up goes the temperature .
i &apos;ve just got one question for you , peter .
every year when it comes to the cotton harvest , the government shuts down the schools , puts the kids in buses , buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton .
the main american manufacturer of that active ingredient decided a few years ago to relocate to china because it &apos;s the world &apos;s biggest supplier of pigs .
and the simple answer is they can &apos;t . they &apos;re national .
if the inspector did come along , it would be amazing if they were able to resist the bribe .
transparency is absolutely critical to this .
&quot; you want me to deliver human rights throughout my global supply chain .
so i appeal to you .
you will put the wind in winsome , lose some .
okay , so these are three things i know to be true .
so i did and stood amazed every week when these brilliant , grown-up poets laughed with me and groaned their sympathy and clapped and told me , &quot; hey , i really felt that too . &quot;
at a certain point , you would realize that someone has the exact same thing , or one thing very similar , to something on your list .
i use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder , to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and , instead , actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them , so that they can reinterpret and create something from it .
and i wondered whether i &apos;d get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out , or not .
they feel exactly what you feel at the same time that you feel it .
i &apos;d like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me to become a documentary photographer .
seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution -- i wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population commenced the final phase of liberation from apartheid .
the next day i left for rwanda , and it was like taking the express elevator to hell .
after the fall of suharto in indonesia , i began to explore conditions of poverty in a country that was on its way towards modernization .
the international community still hasn &apos;t found a way to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide .
last year i spent several months documenting our wounded troops , from the battlefield in iraq all the way home .
you see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a countrywide election is a big project , and big projects are messy .
and on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2d barcode on the right .
david bismark : e-voting without fraud
so we went on and we looked in wikipedia , we found this map .
otherwise it was only christian countries .
most of them are in sub-saharan africa .
but let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at qatar .
we are still debating peak oil , but we have definitely reached peak child .
the rest will grow older and get two billion children .
she gave birth ; i caught the baby ; i got off the island ; i landed in san francisco ; and all the press wanted to talk to me because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in indian affairs .
in the year that larry page and sergey brin -- with whom i have a certain affection and a new affiliation -- in the year in which they were born , two million people died of smallpox .
1974 , we were down to five countries .
but smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication .
aravind , which started as a seva project , is now the world &apos;s largest and best eye hospital .
then there &apos;ll be secondary outbreaks , and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won &apos;t know what hit you .
and what i thought i would call it is &quot; early detection , &quot; but it should really be called &quot; total early detection . &quot;
they reported this to who . who took a little while taking action because who will only receive a report from a government , because it &apos;s the united nations .
but first , let &apos;s just take three numbers .
but first , let &apos;s think of customers .
so think about that .
people sometimes think that 100 percent &apos;s going to be hard , and we &apos;ve had the conversation in the business .
a solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years .
so we know for our 17,000 managers across ikea that 47 percent are women today , but it &apos;s not enough , and we want to close the gap and follow it all the way through to senior management .
i was born into a family of politically active , intellectual atheists .
and it can be sort of crazy-making , housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body .
or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict .
and since we had established some trust , we believed in each other &apos;s sincerity .
in 2007 , i traveled to three war zones .
today the general is a baptized christian evangelist .
the commander told me that a woman could gauge a potentially violent situation much better than men .
now , hundreds of homes were destroyed .
julian , welcome .
and when kibaki got into power -- through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in kenya -- they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
yeah , we see two birds &#91; helicopters &#93; , and we &apos;re still firing .
j yeah .
that &apos;s what they see every day .
and part of the albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
and i think i read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
instead , they publicized your side .
what you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure , wind and temperature readings that were recorded of hurricane noel in 2007 .
when you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
artist nathalie miebach takes weather data from massive storms and turns it into complex sculptures that embody the forces of nature and time . these sculptures then become musical scores for a string quartet to play .
most of the others either never responded back , said they didn &apos;t have the time or didn &apos;t have the equipment and couldn &apos;t help me .
and she &apos;s standing in front of you and she &apos;s explaining to you that little kids will eat their vegetables if they &apos;re different colors .
it &apos;s a huge problem .
naomi shah : hi everyone . i &apos;m naomi shah , and today i &apos;ll be talking to you about my research involving indoor air quality and asthmatic patients .
so i want you to imagine that you &apos;re in julie &apos;s shoes , or someone who &apos;s really close to you who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder .
and air quality and air pollutants have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients , anyone with a respiratory disorder and really all of us in general .
and the whole room , including me , was like , &quot; yeah . &quot;
what is a sexy body ?
and the only purpose that these legs can serve , outside the context of the film , is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination .
it is our humanity , and all the potential within it , that makes us beautiful .
i remember that in the year of 1990 , when i was graduating from college , i was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in beijing , great wall sheraton -- it &apos;s still there .
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china , or at large , the world ?
so how are they different ?
for those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
and fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
i guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
but getting down can be a challenge for small cubs .
but how to reach it ?
some of the world &apos;s astronomers have telescopes nearby .
culture where creativity was consumed but the consumer is not a creator .
but most important was that bmi took public domain works and made arrangements of them , which they gave away for free to their subscribers . so that in 1940 , when ascap threatened to double their rates , the majority of broadcasters switched to bmi .
and i ....
and on the other side , among our kids , there &apos;s a growing copyright abolitionism , a generation that rejects the very notion of what copyright is supposed to do , rejects copyright and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible .
we can &apos;t make our kids passive again .
jack say , &quot; me , mama-san , could we spend the night here ?
its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie .
they &apos;re ready to give you something for whatever it is they &apos;re hungry for . &quot;
think dante , shakespeare , the bible , news of the world .
trained liespotters get to the truth 90 percent of the time .
and we all do it no matter how powerful you are .
they &apos;re going to say , &quot; hey , maybe it was those guys in payroll that forged those checks . &quot;
there &apos;re going to be times when someone makes one expression while masking another that just kind of leaks through in a flash .
don &apos;t try to be like those folks on &quot; law &amp; amp ; order &quot; and those other tv shows that pummel their subjects into submission .
and these technologies are going to be marketed to all of us as panaceas for deceit , and they will prove incredibly useful some day .
it &apos;s been an incredible few days .
if you want to know about africa , read our literature -- and not just &quot; things fall apart , &quot; because that would be like saying , &quot; i &apos;ve read &apos; gone with the wind &apos; and so i know everything about america . &quot;
but these are not new to africa .
and i was growing up in school and the federal government didn &apos;t want us taught about the history of the war , because they thought it probably would make us generate a new generation of rebels .
in the film , &quot; sometimes in april &quot; by raoul peck , idris elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised , and he &apos;s being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend -- fellow rwandan army officer , albeit a tutsi -- played by fraser james .
and i asked millions of people , without questioning my right to do so , to go up against the government .
the fact that it happens in &quot; another country &quot; takes you quite by surprise .
in this deeply personal talk , nigerian writer chris abani says that &quot; what we know about how to be who we are &quot; comes from stories . he searches for the heart of africa through its poems and narrative , including his own .
they take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product .
and so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
ultimately , coke &apos;s success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a coca-cola .
and i think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption , that we think that , if people need something , we don &apos;t have to make them want that .
can you you believe that ?
so what &apos;s the endgame ?
in her talk , melinda gates makes a provocative case for nonprofits taking a cue from corporations such as coca-cola , whose plugged-in , global network of marketers and distributors ensures that every remote village wants -- and can get -- a coke . why shouldn &apos;t this work for condoms , sanitation , vaccinations too ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is what many divers would consider paradise .
these have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world , and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
but , little did i know , until i jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve , and the closer you get to the reserve , the more fish you have .
now , if you do an economic analysis and project what would happen if the fish were not cut , if we brought just 20 divers one month per year , the revenue would be more than 20 times higher and that would be sustainable over time .
it &apos;s a top down hierarchical structure where people wait for government agents to come and this is not effective . and the government doesn &apos;t have enough resources .
they reproduce very slowly ; they have a slow metabolism ; and , basically , they just maintain their biomass .
but the best feeling is this biophilia that e.o. wilson talks about , where humans have this sense of awe and wonder in front of untamed nature , of raw nature .
we have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world .
you hear about giant squid and things like that , but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140 , 160 feet long .
the height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the alps in most cases .
and we started to wonder for a long time , how did it all get down there ?
everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea .
so here , you &apos;ve got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes , inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground .
that &apos;s probably where we evolved from .
oceans come and go . mountains come and go . glaciers come and go .
this stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . math reasoning -- we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach .
notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
and we realize how great would it be if we just had some a , b , c and d labels to talk about them more easily .
so now we have the real deal .
i encourage math teachers i talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : it &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
the whole hadron collider family needs unlocking .
at the age of 14 , in common with many 14-year-olds in the brazilian education system , he dropped out of school .
the other half have one parent because the other parent has died through aids .
so if you look , as i did , through this tour , and by looking at about a hundred case studies of different social entrepreneurs working in these very extreme conditions , look at the recipes that they come up with for learning , they look nothing like school .
that &apos;s too long if you &apos;re poor .
it has 30,000 children on those building sites .
it &apos;s reliable and people know exactly where they are .
and as i said , the trouble with this is that , in the developing world there just aren &apos;t teachers to make this model work .
it &apos;s an amazing thing .
the finding love and respect , the part about trying to find your place in the world .
i clean up . this is not an actual photograph of my son &apos;s room ; his is messier .
you too might be gay ! because i know some gay people who are also single .
some of you may be calling it , what , the constitution of the united states , is that what you call it too ?
i figured if i was a bit irreverent , you wouldn &apos;t find it serious .
and they should be treated with love and respect .
we tend to see commonalities more than differences .
as you may know , the entire world operates on a universal law : entropy , the second law of thermodynamics .
for me , it began as i was approaching my third act , my 60th birthday .
and over time , these neural pathways become hardwired , they become the norm -- even if it &apos;s bad for us because it causes us stress and anxiety .
and the answer of course , like so many things in the world , is sex .
and they get up to all sorts of tricks .
i mean , i think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast .
now if you think that &apos;s fabulous , this is one of my great favorites .
so what is an insect seeing ?
when we think of games , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
so this is zig in this photograph . this is also one of zig &apos;s photographs . he &apos;s a photographer .
this was the boat . it was made quickly obviously .
and i also made a game about the trail of tears .
this is a project called flight patterns .
and you can see , over time , the ways the airports change .
and it &apos;s based on the premise that there are certain things that are easy for people , but really difficult for computers .
the amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes .
we decided to use the mechanical turk for exactly what it was meant for , which is making money .
you type in your code , but you first test your mic .
and we started bouncing around ideas to make a collaborative music video project .
you &apos;re hearing a person &apos;s life .
so this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address , but i &apos;m going to give you a little preview of what you can expect .
and i chose the language of silhouette because graphically it &apos;s very efficient .
so this spider goes through the whole alphabet with identical adjectives and substantives .
other ones are historical .
i was also interested in the physicality of this format , because you have to walk to see it .
here it &apos;s an artist book installation called &quot; identity project . &quot;
and each time i make public art , i want something that &apos;s really relevant to the place it &apos;s installed .
it &apos;s a story about transformation and connections .
and it &apos;s what story cutting is all about .
and according to how you answer that question , people are either incredibly delighted to see you , or look at their watch and make their excuses .
there is one really big problem with this , and that problem is envy .
so that &apos;s another way in which something that is quite positive can have a nasty kickback .
i am a meritocrat in that sense .
in other words , they have failed . and they are described as &quot; losers . &quot;
we &apos;ve put people on the moon . we &apos;ve done all sorts of extraordinary things .
thing about a successful life is , a lot of the time , our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own .
but at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us , whatever has happened in their lives , there will be a strong element of the haphazard .
and i &apos;m not in the present whatsoever .
try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and cnn &apos;s crew , etc .
but no , for some reason i couldn &apos;t wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing , &quot; a heard you knocking at my cellar door i love you baby and i want some more ooh , ooh , the damage done &quot; the night before i started , i finished stephen hawking &apos;s &quot; the grand design . &quot;
the most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish .
they either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
and they can send the poison into the system .
i can feel proud . i can stand here in front of you tonight and say i was courageous .
and so i ask myself , i &apos;m starting to ask myself now , even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me , i &apos;m asking myself , and maybe i can ask you tonight too , to paraphrase the poet mary oliver , she says , &quot; so what is it , what is it you &apos;re doing , with this one wild and precious life of yours ? &quot;
and of course , the desired range -- trying to keep glucose between 75 and less than 200 , checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor -- you &apos;ll see how that can impact diabetes .
i didn &apos;t want to take my shirt off to show you , but i can tell you it &apos;s on .
i didn &apos;t have one of those , but i got the fitbit .
of course how many here have any problems with sleeping ?
eighty percent of americans have chronic disease , or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have two or more chronic disease , 140 million americans have one or more chronic disease , and 80 percent of our 1.5 , whatever , trillion expenditures are related to chronic disease .
so , we can change medicine across the continuum of care , across the ages from premies or unborn children to seniors ; the pharmaceutical arena changes ; the full spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of that -- across the globe .
we lose 700,000 people a year in the u.s. from sudden cardiac death .
pollution , energy shortage , environmental diversity , poverty .
a person comes out , they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do , and then , when it &apos;s time to go back for a billion years -- or a million , i forget , the numbers don &apos;t matter -- but there really aren &apos;t very many people on earth at a time .
and it &apos;s very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making , because he says , what about the consequences ?
genetic algorithms are great for certain things ; i suspect i know what they &apos;re bad at , and i won &apos;t tell you .
and so a few years ago -- fours years ago , actually -- i set out to say , is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder ?
one of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish .
so you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use photoshop -- just the edges .
as you move side to side , it moves off .
we have a chapter on gels .
but you think to yourself , &quot; i &apos;m not quite sure what &apos;s wrong with this guy .
and he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries , wandering around in europe , which is an astonishing number , when you think that surgery must have been a last resort .
the question had to be asked , &quot; well , can we do these same surgeries but through little incisions ? &quot;
and so here you &apos;re seeing the operation of this wrist .
but if you need to reach more places than just one , you need to move the robot .
it &apos;s very exciting to think where we get to go with this .
so , with the combination of these technologies we can reach it all , and we can see it all .
in 2011 , we visited the vancouver waste transfer station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste .
as a result , they easily escape into our environment .
then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth , and found that they shared an inverse correlation , so as bacterial populations increased , phthalate concentrations decreased .
if we &apos;re making plastic synthetically , then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically .
too much rain falls on some areas , and not enough on others .
so now we &apos;re going to go through that door of furniture .
this is a relatively famous chair .
and again , they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype of a house -- architecture , very expensive medium .
but anyway , i remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the eames house when i was a kid .
ed : okay , good .
and we could have been born 100,000 years ago .
and i think that all of us in this room , as you move design forward , it &apos;s not about just doing one thing .
and i think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey .
like this : agricultural workers in africa , whipped and beaten , showing us how they were beaten in the fields before they escaped from slavery and met up with our film crew .
if the rule of law is sound , it protects the poor and it protects the vulnerable .
if you look at a long-term chart , prices are at historical lows and yet global demand for forced labor is still real strong .
you buy them cheaply , you use them , you crumple them up , and then when you &apos;re done with them you just throw them away .
buying people out of slavery is like paying a burglar to get your television back ; it &apos;s abetting a crime .
this is what liberation really looks like .
now , it &apos;s quite an old phenomenon ; it was discovered 100 years ago .
but what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field ?
and this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight .
and so this magical transformation is what i was trying to get at with my project , which became known as the toaster project .
and of course , it wasn &apos;t actually a working mine anymore , because , though ray was a miner there , the mine had closed and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction , because , of course , it can &apos;t compete on the scale of operations which are happening in south america , australia , wherever .
that &apos;s me getting mica .
so there &apos;s a picture of my toaster .
and that really describes information technology .
because i had them through 2002 in my book , &quot; the singularity is near . &quot;
because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . and the project was finished on time .
what now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years .
ray kurzweil &apos;s latest graphs show that technology &apos;s breakneck advances will only accelerate -- recession or not . he unveils his new project , singularity university , to study oncoming tech and guide it to benefit humanity .
but they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings .
voice 2 : come get inside here .
that &apos;s a very powerful idea , and it &apos;s a very powerful reality .
but there is a dark side to this , and that &apos;s what i want to spend the last part of my talk on .
but we know that occasionally ants go astray , and what happens is that , if army ants are wandering around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does .
i got a day job , and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like , let &apos;s supply water to the world , and power to the world , and educate all the kids , which , chris , i will not talk about . i don &apos;t need another mission .
they take the load off , and it becomes , again , compliant .
and i hope you &apos;ll appreciate the level of global coverage that it managed to achieve .
but the romans developed salting .
so it allows us to sample these amazing habitats that are very far from the surface and very far from light .
they went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in new york city and they barcoded it .
and what we see is that for coastal tags , for those organisms that live near the shoreline , they &apos;re most diverse in the tropics .
but it was only discovered in the early 1980s .
and so that turns out to be about two million species once all is said and done .
and so the grand challenge then is to try and make sure that we preserve what &apos;s left , because there is still spectacular beauty .
it &apos;s called pleaching , or grafting trees together , or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous , vascular system .
fellow and urban designer mitchell joachim presents his vision for sustainable , organic architecture : eco-friendly abodes grown from plants and -- wait for it -- meat .
and you know what i found out ?
it is an elevation of us beyond ourselves .
so , here we are .
movement is the only way you have of affecting the world around you .
there &apos;s no competition at all .
and it sounds like an easy problem .
you want to generate beliefs about the world .
if you &apos;re playing against a very good opponent , they may distribute it in that green area , which is the prior distribution , making it hard for you to return .
so i get two sources .
and as we go from naught to 0.1 second , it becomes more ticklish .
and the game is very simple .
and i can hold my arm in a particular joint configuration either very stiff or very relaxed .
so what i can show you here is how the variability of the movement will evolve if i choose that way .
dw : so people have found out for example that studying vision in the absence of realizing why you have vision is a mistake .
this is a viking lander photograph of the surface of mars .
we believe there &apos;s some water in the polar caps , there are polar caps of north pole and south pole .
the most intriguing and puzzling measurement , in my opinion , we &apos;ve obtained of mars , was released earlier this year in the magazine science .
but look in the southern hemisphere .
we preprogram it .
the rocket engine begins .
we are on the verge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the earth &apos;s atmosphere .
and she said , &quot; no , the lego is the treasure . &quot;
the lego guys don &apos;t give you any royalties , strangely , but some user made this and then it sold .
hillel cooperman : legos for grownups
they committed that they &apos;re going to take their existing stores and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent , and their new stores by 30 percent , and do all that in seven years .
consumers don &apos;t really like these light bulbs .
because california was the first state in this country to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 .
the fourth and final lesson we &apos;ve learned is about the potential of radical innovation .
but i &apos;m really afraid we need much , much more .
it is the mother of all markets . you remember that internet ?
and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
but things don &apos;t just diffuse in human populations at random .
a. and you have an immediate appreciation that a is going to be more likely to get the thing that &apos;s spreading and to get it sooner by virtue of their structural location within the network .
and that happens at every peripheral node .
we &apos;re going to take daily cuts through the network for 120 days .
well , some other scientists have estimated what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample of these 1000 people , 300 people and immunized them .
or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors , passively , and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals occurs within &#91; networks of &#93; doctors .
at these large-scale construction sites in china , you see a sort of makeshift camp where workers live during the entire building process .
they typically make the best out of their conditions , and try to make their spaces look nice and homey , or at least up until as far as they can reach .
they &apos;re descendants of farmers who began migrating from the upper egypt in the &apos; 40s , and today they make their living by collecting and recycling waste from homes from all over cairo .
what moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions , i was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love , care , and unreserved passion .
but fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time .
when soldiers came across roadside bombs in iraq and afghanistan , instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick , as they used to do up until about 2002 , they now send the robot out .
the eyes are on the screen there .
they go to factories around the country .
but over the next 40 years , it &apos;s going to change dramatically , even in china .
let me show you how it works .
what you &apos;re looking at in here is a 3d viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of &#91; the &#93; cloud of points in real time , cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions .
two years ago , we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important heritage site , a unesco heritage site in uganda , the royal kasubi tombs .
and doug pritchard , who &apos;s the head of visualization at the glasgow school of art .
and the reason i give you this moment is there &apos;s a deep truth in it .
they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced , i think , 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan .
and the holocaust culture that we have in this country makes americans , sort of , more prone to , i think , want to bring never again to life .
he was drawn to the flames , he chased the flames , he was like a moth to the flames . something of an adrenalin junkie .
he then goes to rwanda and to congo in the aftermath of the genocide , and he &apos;s the guy who has to decide -- huh , ok , the genocide is over ; 800,000 people have been killed ; the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries -- into congo , into tanzania .
like a refugee . because he represents the u.n.
but by the end of his life , i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from .
in times of fear , for instance , one of the things sergio used to say is , fear is a bad advisor .
for most people , if they think about hunger , they don &apos;t have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives , or their parents &apos; lives , or their grandparents &apos; lives -- to remember an experience of hunger .
this isn &apos;t one of those rare diseases that we don &apos;t have the solution for .
so this burden of knowledge drives me .
and this is climate-proof .
cameroon , northern cameroon , boom and bust cycles of hunger every year for decades .
and what &apos;s happened in the past year alone is the dairy industry -- where this card &apos;s used for milk and yogurt and eggs and hummus -- the dairy industry has gone up 30 percent .
the fact is studies show that the cost of malnutrition and hunger -- the cost to society , the burden it has to bear -- is on average six percent , and in some countries up to 11 percent , of gdp a year .
and the point of the article was that we have gotten reductionist in our view of biology , in our view of cancer .
because evolution doesn &apos;t care about us after we &apos;ve had our children .
so , hopefully , we will go from being the art of medicine more to the science of medicine , and be able to do what they do in infectious disease , which is look at that organism , that bacteria , and then say , &quot; this antibiotic makes sense , because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it . &quot;
it &apos;s what we call a system .
and i didn &apos;t realize that for three hours i &apos;m sitting at my desk , and i &apos;m not moving at all .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the power of these magnets , the power of what we can do here , is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology .
you don &apos;t need to shrink the disease .
when it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge .
this is surf .
so , ask yourself : is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour ? i don &apos;t think so .
they are all important . and every brand needs to have guidelines at the center .
playing sound effects both pleasant and awful , julian treasure shows how sound affects us in four significant ways . listen carefully for a shocking fact about noisy open-plan offices .
he &apos;s trying to find and solve water issues , the crisis around the world .
we looked at each other with these looks of disbelief at what we had just completed .
for me , as a scientist , it all began in 1953 when i first tried scuba .
tim worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment .
to see -- wait a minute , we can go kshhplash ! -- right there , ha -- under the ocean , see what the whales see .
we &apos;re still killing bluefin tuna ; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .
and in 1872 , with yellowstone national park , the united states began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea america ever had .
we need new ways , better ways , to cope with poverty , wars and disease .
i &apos;m obsessed with insects , particularly insect flight .
they have antennae that sense odors and detect wind detection .
now i realize that it is a little bit absurd to compare the behavioral repertoire of a human to a fly .
but let &apos;s think about this . how can you make a small number of neurons do a lot ?
it &apos;s part of their visual guidance system .
why are we doing this ?
99 percent of what you see is not what comes in through the eyes .
they were so successful in evolution that what we did was to duplicate them over and over and add more and more of them to the brain until we ran out of space in the skull .
they choose very carefully who they connect with .
we can position them in different places , orient them in different places .
here we activate it . and this gives the first glimpse of what is happening in your brain when there is a stimulation .
steve told us about the future of little technology ; i &apos;m going to show you some of the past of big technology .
it was the first project funded by arpa .
they built a high-explosive propelled model .
this is crew compartment . it switches , so what &apos;s upside down is right side up when you go to artificial gravity mode .
not yours , of course -- other people &apos;s .
people write me about their personal experience , and about their examples , and what they disagree , and nuances .
turns out they &apos;re identical .
when you ask people this question , they usually think that it has to be something about culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot , have a slightly different form .
and because we have no idea what to do we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us .
now think of it . this decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .
this was an ad from the economist a few years ago that gave us three choices .
and as a consequence , people chose it .
the behavioral economics perspective is slightly less generous to people .
the way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular , radio waves .
it &apos;s good for a nice suntan , but otherwise dangerous for the human body .
and it has a very nice acute property .
and that &apos;s a video , a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam .
if the whole world would deploy them , you would save hundreds of power plants .
in hospitals , for new medical instruments ; in streets for traffic control .
i thought i &apos;d take a moment to tell you what a genome is .
everything that happens in digital is converted , or a representation , of a one and a zero .
the first human genome took 10 years , three billion dollars .
most importantly , what we &apos;re learning is that nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox .
so , we could , you know , focus on disease resistance ; we can go for higher yields without necessarily having dramatic farming techniques to do it , or costs .
and , you know , people would always ask james watson -- he &apos;s not always the most politically correct guy ...
and if we don &apos;t make that a reward in training , that will be a distraction .
of course , female dogs , bitches , on the other hand , have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule .
the dog doesn &apos;t speak english , or american , or spanish , or french .
basically , we follow a low-frequency behavior -- one the dog doesn &apos;t want to do -- by a high-frequency behavior , commonly known as a behavior problem , or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do .
and so we have to enforce , but without force .
how are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear ?
i &apos;m standing right here with my bag .
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s some schadenfreude there , that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong , so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them .
ah , damn , i wanted to end exactly on time , but i got eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two -- so thank you very much . that &apos;s my talk , thank you .
the book had three , yours had four .
wk : yeah .
i &apos;m kind of hoping some conversations here might help me finish it .
that &apos;s the thing .
i want to talk to you briefly about perception .
it &apos;s a multiplication of two prime numbers .
four across , four up and down -- it &apos;s 16 .
they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion .
how did we achieve that , whether you think it &apos;s a good thing or not ?
and more than that , it &apos;s a confection of different ideas , the idea of plastic , the idea of a laser , the idea of transistors .
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
and the answer is about half a second .
they &apos;re in bistros and cafes and restaurants and shops all over paris , and they &apos;re all ready to serve you at an hour &apos;s notice with an excellent meal that &apos;s probably got higher quality than louis xiv even had .
and the man knows that he doesn &apos;t have to do any digging to get roots .
you also see seashells -- as discovered by a team here in oxford -- moving 125 miles inland from the mediterranean in algeria .
the president of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know .
matt ridley : when ideas have sex
one out of four people , one out of four humans in prison are americans , imprisoned in our country .
we just dismiss it out of our consciousness .
our cultural joy , our national joy is nowhere to be seen .
this is a picornavirus .
here &apos;s the section on the all-important emergency stop switch .
all right , i can see a rhinovirus -- and here &apos;s the blow-up of the rhinovirus &apos;s little barcode -- but what about different rhinoviruses ?
actually , we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses even when you &apos;re walking around healthy .
if , for example , you used a cell culture that &apos;s chronically infected with papilloma , you get a little computer readout here , and our algorithm says it &apos;s probably papilloma type 18 .
they have their own tests , of course , and so they tested her for over 70 different assays , for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay you can buy off the shelf : sars , metapneumovirus , hiv , rsv -- all these .
and we know who &apos;s got defects in rnasel and who doesn &apos;t .
this is a collaboration between myself and don .
perhaps overlooked , volta &apos;s invention of the battery for the first time also demonstrated the utility of a professor .
it &apos;s fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that &apos;s a solution of salt and water .
and this forces magnesium to de-alloy and return to the upper electrode , restoring the initial constitution of the battery .
the technology was proving itself to be robust and scalable .
in a battery , i strive to maximize electrical potential ; when mentoring , i strive to maximize human potential .
what we &apos;ve built isn &apos;t unique .
what can we discover when there &apos;s thousands of these devices roaming the seas ?
and another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was &quot; powers of ten , &quot; charles and ray eames &apos; film .
i can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel , so you sculpt it like clay . we have parts here that i can put on or pull off .
so that &apos;s kind of what these tools are about , are : how do we make the game play the player &apos;s imagination-amplifier ?
so at first they &apos;ll go up , and then they &apos;ll evaporate , and that &apos;ll be my planet .
if we pull all the way back , we start seeing the entire galaxy here , kind of slowly in motion . and this is another thing where , typically when people present galaxies , it &apos;s always been these very beautiful photos , but they &apos;re always static . and when you actually bring it forward in time and start animating it , it &apos;s actually kind of amazing , what a galaxy would look like , fast forwarded .
here they are arriving at number 10 , and look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the president of the united states . oh , and here comes the prime minister of the — ? no .
it &apos;s about opening up . and this is true across the animal kingdom . it &apos;s not just limited to primates .
women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising . but the other thing i noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating , and how well they were participating .
but really , power is also about how you react to stress .
so again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
they &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . they &apos;re blind to the conditions .
it took me four years longer than my peers , and i convinced someone , my angel advisor , susan fiske , to take me on , and so i ended up at princeton , and i was like , i am not supposed to be here .
tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
and yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking .
freedom , if you &apos;re from new hampshire .
it is , on the one hand , a biological effect , and a very large one .
and that &apos;s what a meme is . it &apos;s an information packet with attitude .
a meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness .
we &apos;re a free society , so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off .
my job depends upon it .
if you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
south africans just make music really freely .
now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session had enshrined in its heart the theme , which is ted .
one more time , with feeling , ladies and gentlemen .
and i was born without my left hand -- right hand .
conductor charles hazlewood talks about the role of trust in musical leadership -- then shows how it works , as he conducts the scottish ensemble onstage . he also shares clips from two musical projects : the opera &quot; u-carmen ekhayelitsha &quot; and the paraorchestra .
and because we had a good business model , we actually did it , and i watched these women transform on a micro-level .
where we typically work , there &apos;s people making between one and three dollars a day .
malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year .
and so i want you to meet jacqueline , my namesake , 21 years old .
to the first son , he left half the camels .
and it &apos;s a big family reunion , and yet , like many family reunions , it &apos;s not all peace and light .
because if you think about it , normally when we think of conflict , when we describe it , there &apos;s always two sides -- it &apos;s arabs versus israelis , labor versus management , husband versus wife , republicans versus democrats .
the conversation got back on track .
let &apos;s see if we can apply the third side to it .
they need to be able to live the story . how would you do that ?
so effectively , we went from womb to tomb .
he said it was like a light that went on in our lives .
well i think back to my childhood , a good part of which i spent , after being born here in chicago , i spent in europe .
william ury : the walk from &quot; no &quot; to &quot; yes &quot;
and i want you to start on a project which in his language he called &quot; uwankara palyanku kanyintjaku , &quot; which , translated , is &quot; a plan to stop people getting sick , &quot; a profound brief .
i hear some &quot; aw &quot; s and i hear some &quot; aah . &quot;
by the evening of the first day , a few houses in that community are better than when we started in the morning .
the people living in the house are actually a major part of the solution .
and the doctor of flies very quickly determined that there was one fly that carried the bug .
solution : take human waste , take animal waste , put it into a chamber , out of that extract biogas , methane gas .
paul pholeros : how to reduce poverty ? fix homes
just quick refresher , it &apos;s d-y-k-e .
our challenge is to find the compassion for others that we want them to have for us .
and it starts with three people .
and those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce , with plastic forks , and we get it into the cafeteria , and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers .
really scholastic , if you ask me .
but more importantly is my kids learned to get , they learned to give .
thank god omar knows that carrots come from the ground , and not aisle 9 at the supermarket or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam .
we take orders now . i &apos;m booking for the spring .
and most importantly , get the biggest bully out of schools .
we are growing our way into a new economy .
and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin , like you see in an emergency room , and i &apos;m going to show you why they don &apos;t work very well .
tonight you &apos;ll see some of our invented stents .
we &apos;ve called the ambulance . the ambulance is on the way .
eyewitness news reporter stacy sager tonight , with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away .
form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy , as well as other diseases of the brain , because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it , that causes many , if not all , of brain disorders .
if the electrical signals create a brain disorder , electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain &apos;s neurons .
that &apos;s the present system . how about making a video ?
but then we decided we needed to do something more .
on the ground and around the world people are still curious , and trying to figure out what is going on . but they don &apos;t know .
in the last two years of his life , when he was sick , he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me .
i &apos;m rich baraniuk .
ok , everybody imagine books and imagine just tearing out the pages .
ok , what about people who are mixing ? what does &quot; mixing &quot; mean ?
because it &apos;s published on demand and it &apos;s developed from this repository of open materials .
and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i , as an engineer , could write this book that would get all of this across .
in fact , you &apos;re free to share it , to do all of these things , to copy it , to change it , even to make commercial use of it as long as you attribute the author .
there &apos;s only one other person here , i think , who did that .
it didn &apos;t scale but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries , and learning pretty quickly that these kids -- even though english wasn &apos;t their language , the latin alphabet barely was their language , but they could just swim like fish ; they could play these like pianos .
and this particular manufacturer said , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;re not interested in that . we &apos;re interested in the living room .
now the display on your laptop costs , in rough numbers , 10 dollars a diagonal inch .
and whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software is to be seen .
seven countries .
the gray market &apos;s a big issue . and one of the ways -- just one -- but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market is to make something that is so utterly unique .
well , on december 12 , a company called quanta agreed to build it , and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today , that question disappeared .
but now what we &apos;re looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
and i said , &quot; dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ? &quot;
it &apos;s not that we &apos;re always connected to everybody , but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want .
amber case : we are all cyborgs now
i think there &apos;s an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is hiv-positive , she &apos;s going to infect her child .
and so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes .
we &apos;re all hiv-positive .
our organization has three goals .
and it &apos;s important about disclosure .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors , and so we need to find new paradigm for health care .
that is 20 percent of the global hiv-positive pregnant women -- 20 percent of the world .
so this is a model of the human brain , and this is prefrontal cortex , right at the front .
the director , standing behind the set of shelves , is going to direct you to move objects around , but remember , he &apos;s not going to ask you to move objects that he can &apos;t see . this introduces a really interesting condition whereby there &apos;s a kind of conflict between your perspective and the director &apos;s perspective .
so for example , take risk-taking . we know that adolescents have a tendency to take risks . they do .
so i couldn &apos;t wait to get started to work on this so i could introduce kevin to my robot .
he said , &quot; is the robot real ? &quot;
but that night , as we were packing up , i asked the tele-actor , how did the tele-directors decide that they would give a kiss to sam donaldson ?
so we record all these examples , the data , and then we go through a sequence of steps .
thank you .
or , people are not people without other people .
so we took them up to his house , and this visit of the philanthropist to his house coincided with a time when solly &apos;s wife , who was learning english , was going through a phase where she would open the door by saying , &quot; hello , i love you .
the bone is cracked .
in fact , solly gave her the name elvis because he said she walked like she was doing the elvis the pelvis dance .
and it is not only through other people that we get to experience our humanity but through all the creatures that live on this planet .
he said , if mae west can be m-a-e , why can &apos;t keshava be k-a-e ?
but of course i continued creating artwork that was honest and raw , because i forgot about how people reacted to my work .
maybe we are the first to even actively record our lives .
i was so inspired .
it seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids , like me , to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn &apos;t good for us or the planet .
so i ask myself , how can i change ? how can i change these things ?
so next time you &apos;re at the grocery store , think local , choose organic , know your farmer and know your food .
but before i do , i just want you to ponder this graph for a moment .
the average depths are about 12,000 ft .
the peaks that don &apos;t come out of the water are the seamounts .
but back to the phoenix islands , which is the subject of this talk .
i went back to the states and started looking around to see if i could find examples where reverse fishing licenses had been issued , and it turned out there were none .
well , the good news is it &apos;s recovered and recovering fast , faster than any reef we &apos;ve seen .
here &apos;s the pacific with large mpas and large conservation zones on it .
the problem is , i don &apos;t think these projections are accurate .
but they &apos;re getting better quite quickly , and darpa , which is the investment arm of the defense department , is trying to accelerate their trajectory .
let me give you a couple examples .
i &apos;m going to leave the last word to a guy who had a front row seat for digital progress , our old friend ken jennings . i &apos;m with him .
there &apos;s one from a consumer &apos;s point of view -- where i was happy while experiencing design .
and the theory was that if you abstract an image , you really , you know open as much room for the un-representable -- and , therefore , you know , are able to involve the viewer more .
i mean , that &apos;s , at least , how it made me happy .
jee gets to have his project ; the public gets a sweeter environment ; and different public gets a place to express itself ; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads .
this is : &quot; having &quot; -- this is the same thing ; it &apos;s just , you know , photographed from the side .
it happens mainly under two conditions .
their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society &apos;s treatment of the elderly .
hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth .
for example , only americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs .
they almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today .
the 99 references the 99 attributes of allah in the koran , things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about .
to which he said , &quot; let them be , because what they &apos;re giving us is worth a lot more than what we &apos;re paying them . &quot;
and the swiss psychoanalyst , carl jung , also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures , so i figure i &apos;m covered .
so from day one , the people involved in the project , bottom left is fabian nicieza , writer for x-men and power rangers .
the bad news is they were all photocopies , so we didn &apos;t make a dime in revenue .
you are noora the light .
i left bellevue , went to business school and started this .
and what rayan did then is he sat there , he tapped his foot on the floor , at three and a half , and he looked at me and he said , &quot; baba , i want you to come with me to my office in my house .
so , let &apos;s see .
so , by visualizing this information , we turned it into a landscape that you can explore with your eyes , a kind of map really , a sort of information map .
well , november , christmas video games come out , and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content .
you might want to get some chocolate in .
i feel that everyday , all of us now are being blasted by information design .
it &apos;s got to be america , right ?
so , absolute figures , like the military budget , in a connected world , don &apos;t give you the whole picture .
so it spawns itself .
so , just to wrap up , i wanted to say that it feels to me that design is about solving problems and providing elegant solutions , and information design is about solving information problems .
the lush heart note , melaleuca bark note -- which does not contain any melaleuca bark , because it &apos;s totally forbidden .
why doesn &apos;t it smell of potatoes or violets ? well , there are really two theories .
a theory is something that enables you to do less work .
now , after searching high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration .
ok . now . if something absorbs the energy , the electron can travel .
and we actually , in this case , i &apos;m sorry to say , it happened -- it was serendipitous .
what are we going to do about it ? i define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
each year , one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the irs .
harry potter was a foster child .
a little break .
and it turns out i &apos;ve got the devil inside of me .
by the way , years later , my social worker said that i should never have been put in there .
i don &apos;t mean children . i mean the child of the state .
i doubt many of you in the audience can see the fossil that &apos;s in this picture , but if you look very carefully , there is a jaw , a lower jaw , of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape as it was found at lake turkana on the west side .
and we really have only spent 50 years looking for these remains , and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story .
unfortunately for him , he fell into a swamp and couldn &apos;t get out .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation , or is it going to lead us to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet earth ?
we could tell every single human being out there , if we really wanted to .
russian nuclear launch key : the one on the top is the picture of the one i found on ebay ; the one on the bottom is the one i made for myself , because i couldn &apos;t afford the one on ebay .
this is the kind of accuracy that i wanted , and i replicated every last bone and put it in .
i found other reference . avi &#91; ara &#93; chekmayan , a new jersey editor , actually found this resin maltese falcon at a flea market in 1991 , although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers &apos; specifications , because there was a lot of controversy about it .
terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer of the black dahlia .
on the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica i bought on ebay .
i &apos;d been hit by a speeding utility truck with only 10 minutes to go on the bike ride .
it was the fight of my life .
and the question i asked myself is , if i couldn &apos;t do that , then who was i ?
and i said , &quot; not me , not janine the machine , &quot; which was my nickname .
and i realized that this wasn &apos;t just my life .
i &apos;m holding on to the counter because i can &apos;t stand .
didn &apos;t know how on earth i &apos;d ever pass a medical .
it wasn &apos;t until i let go of the life i thought i should have that i was able to embrace the life that was waiting for me .
i &apos;m not a scientist . i could have been , perhaps , but i work in this world where i trust my instincts .
that is like an anish kapoor flowing through a richard serra .
how the hell do i do a telephone in three weeks , when you get these things that take hundreds of million years to evolve ?
any one of those elements you could sort of hang on the wall as some kind of art object .
if he was a car designer , phew , we &apos;d all be driving one .
this is some current work i &apos;m doing .
that is an image of a car for me .
can you imagine ? a car on a stick .
yeah , and it has an internal handrail which gives it it &apos;s strength . it &apos;s this holistic integration .
lots of stuff . there &apos;s a little leaf chair -- that golden looking thing is called &quot; leaf . &quot;
it was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet .
but i started to realize that i could actually identify animals by the type of flashes they produced .
this fish actually has high beams .
he has no lure for attracting food and no teeth for eating it when it gets there .
that &apos;s not luminescence , that &apos;s reflected light from the gonads .
and you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was , because we cast these 16 blue leds in epoxy and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used , the word ziploc is still visible .
i promise , you &apos;ll love it .
while all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
homosexual necrophilia .
and there are nine other winners who get prizes .
it &apos;s remarkable : the position .
in the u.s. alone , a billion birds die in collision with glass buildings .
it &apos;s when i started to feel that the cybernetic device was no longer a device .
some people , i would never relate , but they sound similar .
i can hear if someone points at me with a remote control .
and our guide was a local science teacher .
the case went on for two years ; i think he &apos;s still appealing the case .
well , the healthcare system has been transformed : a culture pervaded with defensiveness , universal distrust of the system of justice , universal practice of defensive medicine .
and how has this system of law worked for government ?
but the challenge here is not one of just amending the law , because the hurdle for success is trust .
those dikes have burst . people wade through law all day long .
as you &apos;re going down , and walking down the sidewalk during the day , you have to think that if there is a dispute , there &apos;s somebody in society who sees it as their job to affirmatively protect you if you &apos;re acting reasonably .
what the world needs now is to restore the authority to make common choices .
more and more rules to protect us against an indifferent , uncaring set of institutions we have to deal with .
so one example is he sees these stonemasons working on the isle of lesbos , and they need to measure out round columns .
michael &apos;s a young guy .
and he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery .
people have to make a living .
so these are little ordinary , everyday heroes , and they &apos;re incredibly admirable , but there &apos;s no way that they can sustain this kind of activity in the face of a system that either roots them out or grinds them down .
stayed with them , followed up on them , made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan had been jointly developed to get them over the hump .
we &apos;ll see .
and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry , until this very moment , we &apos;ve actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that &apos;s characterized by two phases , which i &apos;m going to go through with you right now .
and the danger of that , of course , is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter-launch , even though the first country had not actually launched anything .
they would propose -- actually there were about six volumes written on this -- a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning that the soviets were going to attack us .
and it &apos;s particularly not secure in the former soviet union , now in russia .
well , what we &apos;re seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized .
you don &apos;t want to build a suitcase bomb , and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist .
so if there &apos;s any way that you can avoid , like , avert your eyes , that would be a good thing .
and the farther you are away in distance , the longer it is in time from the initial blast ; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere , the better .
we &apos;ve been hearing them today and yesterday and every day for decades .
enormous innovation , enormous energy , enormous talent now has been mobilized through this structure to try to deal with all of these challenges .
and that &apos;s really clear now .
the solution becomes self-sustaining .
but the more deeply i got into all these social issues , one after another , and actually , the more i tried to address them myself , personally , in a few cases , through nonprofits that i was involved with , the more i found actually that the reality is the opposite .
this is a company that &apos;s brought drip irrigation technology to thousands and millions of farmers , reducing substantially the use of water .
young people , i think , my harvard business school students , are getting it .
right there .
just like this , students can isolate anybody and dissect any way you want to .
the members of the association are shocked to realize that it &apos;s the poet samuel taylor coleridge , who hadn &apos;t even left his house in years until that day .
in the cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813 , the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts .
i mean , this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year .
that &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
but it was an exciting experience .
except , if you look a little bit closer , you see , in fact , that this thing is way too small to be anything like that .
but the interesting thing about these computer virus infections was that , if you look at the rate at which the infection worked , they show this spiky behavior that you &apos;re used to from a flu virus .
and all different strains are colored in different colors .
so here would be a frequency plot of how often you find each of the 26 letters of the alphabet in a text written by random monkeys .
so this also turns out to be extremely robust .
and indeed , we &apos;re going to be dropping these guys into that soup all the time .
life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets .
it &apos;s kind of on its way out now , but we still use it for 99 percent of our stuff .
sometimes it can take two years to type that information into a computer , and sometimes , actually not infrequently , it actually never happens .
while i was doing it , my business partner , rose , who &apos;s here with her husband , matthew , here in the audience , rose was out doing similar stuff for the american red cross .
but the miracle that happened , i &apos;m going to call it hotmail for short .
it &apos;s cloud-based , and it doesn &apos;t require any training , programming , consultants .
joel selanikio : the surprising seeds of a big-data revolution in healthcare
well , in a balloon it &apos;s easy , we have ballast .
and that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas .
we slowed down . and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers .
it allowed to do all those things there .
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot , the batteries , flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency .
and there , there will be just one goal , just one : reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty .
you can just go on solarimpulse.com , subscribe to just be informed of what we &apos;re doing .
what turns me on about the digital age , what excites me personally , is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing .
they called me , &quot; the girl with the beard . &quot;
the right to live , period .
we &apos;re standing around with watering cans , when what we really need is the fire brigade .
and that might be smart in these nervous , dangerous times .
and because we can , we must .
economists confirm it , and they know much more than i do .
this could be the time that we finally get serious about changing the future for most people who live on planet earth .
as i say , there &apos;re two things on the line here .
i believe it &apos;s possible .
we need to get the math ; we need to get the statistics out to the american people .
i think it &apos;s possible .
i am , of course , referring to none other than elvis presley .
now , synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ in another sense organ as well , such as colored hearing .
the participants had to identify , as quickly as possible , the literally false sentences .
each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy : world war ii , vietnam , and the third was historically neutral .
james geary : metaphorically speaking
is it going to be another somalia ?
i &apos;m not a yemeni ; i &apos;m not an indian . &quot;
he has been very supportive of me .
n well the yemen times , across 20 years , has been through so much .
pm : yes , you are .
nadia al-sakkaf : see yemen through my eyes
and i gave up salt , i went vegan , and i started taking huge doses of sildenafil , also known as viagra .
he was a big figure in all of our lives , and we loved him very much .
i performed here and there , but as my condition deteriorated , so did my voice .
i flew to cleveland , and my family rushed there in hopes that they would meet me and say what we knew might be our final goodbye .
it &apos;s about living .
one is that you and i all have between 30 to 50,000 chemicals in our bodies that our grandparents didn &apos;t have .
in some cases , another species like the north american leopard frog showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes .
and for those of you who are not parents , sippy cups are those little plastic things that your child graduates to after using bottles .
and this is not just philosophical , it &apos;s already known , that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen , pcbs , ddt cross the placenta and effectively determine and obesity and diabetes already when the baby &apos;s in the womb .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s just profound and sad , but astonishing because so many of us don &apos;t actually know this .
we know what we &apos;re putting out there , we have a sense of those repercussions , but we are so ignorant of this sense of what happens when we put things , or things are put into our bodies .
we use two million of them in the united states every five minutes , here imaged by ted presenter chris jordan , who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail .
i thought i would spend 20 bucks .
now , the market can do a lot for us , but it can &apos;t fix the natural system in the ocean we &apos;ve broken .
even so , about four percent of the primeval redwood rainforest remains intact , wild and now protected -- entirely protected -- in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls along the north coast of california , including redwood national park .
that is to say , at that time it was believed that there was nothing up there except the branches of redwood trees .
it became a writing project .
now , here we see a reiteration in chronos , one of the older redwoods .
they &apos;ve wired them like patients in an icu .
one of the things that is just -- i almost can &apos;t conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn &apos;t picked this up at all , and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in north america .
but lately , the doors of the palace have been flung open , and the walls are coming down .
that &apos;s 25 years ago .
for example , let &apos;s go with the centipede virus first .
so how do these guys then monetize those infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- like how security people work -- and try to work their way around any security precautions we can build .
you &apos;ll actually see that down here you can see a web address : unionseek.com / d / ioo.exe and when you view this image on your computer it actually is going to download and run that program .
and if you actually take a look at the scene picture , you can see that the plate of the mercedes is o600ko78rus .
we must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail .
now before i get into how to do it let me give you a little truth in advertising , because i &apos;m not engaged in the business of magic .
if you &apos;re trying to influence corporations to change their behavior , with regard to producing pollutants , one approach , the common approach , is to exhort them to be better , to explain to them what damage they &apos;re doing to the planet .
to 1,200 ? no .
so with just that little bit of input we can work out what the choices are that people have , what the chances are that they &apos;re willing to take , what they &apos;re after , what they value , what they want , and what they believe about other people .
it would achieve some national pride , but not go ahead and build a weapon .
ok , so i &apos;d like you to take a little away from this .
so , if you &apos;re in the audience today , or maybe you &apos;re watching this talk in some other time or place , you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem .
well , most rights owners , instead of blocking , will allow the copy to be published .
it &apos;s not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners .
the smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us .
i &apos;m on a remote island in micronesia .
the wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot .
true navigation begins in the human heart .
but we all know that that &apos;s bullshit at times .
and the reason is , it &apos;s about appreciation and it &apos;s about contribution . you can only feel so much by yourself .
and you correct me if i &apos;m wrong .
and that sounds really heavy , but in the last five or 10 years , 15 years , how have there been some decisions you &apos;ve made that if you &apos;d made a different decision , your life would be completely different ? how many can think about it ?
your model of the world is what shapes you long term .
we need variety . we need surprise .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s true -- we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayer , through walking in nature .
i got my friends involved and i grew companies and then i got 11 companies and i built the foundation .
he said , &quot; if you leave and go to that hawaii thing , it &apos;s over with us . &quot;
i &apos;ve been playing ted for nearly a decade , and i &apos;ve very rarely played any new songs of my own .
you know , as i look around the world i see a lot of gaps , and i think we all see a lot of gaps .
the diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside , so that the large dots contain large sentences , and the small dots contain small sentences .
these are automatically constructed using the found objects : &quot; i think i feel a little full . &quot;
you can see the little pink cursor moving along , representing our position .
you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted .
nobody &apos;s seen this yet , publicly .
we can isolate just the photographs , and we now see those .
so if i put in climate change for all of 2006 , we &apos;ll see what that universe looks like .
it seems like they &apos;re everyone &apos;s default doom-and-gloom metaphor .
what would that mean ?
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by shearing winds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly , and in the middle , in between , you get this undulating of the air , and if the difference in those speeds is just right , the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices .
the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data , terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information .
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; scattering of x-rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
and again , it &apos;s fully interactive , so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
so motts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor cortex .
i can peel off the layer of the lion .
and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides .
he said , &quot; ok . i measured the height of a brick .
the standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- inflationary energy -- which blew it up .
the density of matter is finite , and we have a chance of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s gdp in 1960 , around the time of independence for many african states .
and to my astonishment , they backed me 100 percent .
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students -- and it &apos;s not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m.
i will be attending aims .
i want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture .
and our partners across africa are extremely enthusiastic about this .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neurons .
and let me just summarize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
now , what &apos;s happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer behave like this .
ok , so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory , it sends it into the processor or the alu , and then it puts the result back into memory .
this is kareem &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
and i think a lot of people in africa have this different perspective , and i think that &apos;s going to impact technology .
so , this is a little tricky .
and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius , there is actually only one thing i really need to know .
and yet , what we actually see is light that can &apos;t be explained by the starlight .
and the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole .
so , without this technology you can &apos;t see the stars .
to give you a sense of how small that size is , that &apos;s the size of our solar system .
so , you shouldn &apos;t see young stars .
and this means that these things do exist in our universe , and we have to contend with this , we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .
one day in new york , i was on the street and i saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants .
and the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries , as have our preferences for them .
and every musical era had different priorities of these things , different things to pass on , different &apos; whats &apos; and &apos; hows &apos; .
and the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the scores , the codebooks of music , into the hands of performers everywhere .
what &apos;s the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?
you don &apos;t need to worry about knowing anything .
so turbines grew . and they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height , but they can &apos;t really go a lot higher , and more height is where the more wind is , and more power -- as much as twice as much .
and the spruce goose would be a 15-megawatt wing .
but he wrote that for his wife .
and another thing that both of these have in common is your state of mind , because i don &apos;t -- i &apos;m one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted , so if i &apos;m trying to do homework , if i &apos;m trying to do homework and i don &apos;t feel like it , i &apos;ll try to draw or , you know , waste my time .
i &apos;m going to try to put that in some sort of order .
and so jon had a brilliant idea : he went out to recruit the best of the best dancers off of youtube to create this dance troupe -- the league of extraordinary dancers , the lxd .
absent desire , not going to happen .
and , very happily , there &apos;s one class of people who really can &apos;t make use of this tool .
and that &apos;s why what i &apos;m excited about , and what i think is under-reported , is the significance of the rise of online video .
it can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print .
the world &apos;s ambitious innovators and influencers now could get their ideas to spread far and wide , and so the art of the spoken word pretty much withered on the vine .
we can &apos;t stop learning at age 21 .
we have our own film school .
so if you came here to talk about how french coffee will spread happiness in our brains , that &apos;s a go .
slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
but before i do that , let me tell you a couple of things that made this possible .
here &apos;s the key feature though . these neurons are also involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas , and i put some symbols up here that we assign value to for various reasons .
one area is called experimental economics . the other area is called behavioral economics .
when methane built up , or carbon dioxide built up , or oxygen was diminished , the birds would swoon before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system : hey , get out of the mine . things aren &apos;t going so well .
mice , bugs and hamsters are no longer the only way to study the brain . functional mri allows scientists to map brain activity in living , breathing , decision-making human beings . read montague gives an overview of how this technology is helping us understand the complicated ways in which we interact with each other .
now , if you combine this very simple , very conservative thought -- go with the grain of human nature -- with all the advances in behavioral economics , some of which we were just hearing about , again , i think we can achieve a real increase in well-being , in happiness , in a stronger society without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money .
so we &apos;re now living in a post-bureaucratic age , where genuine people power is possible .
you can see what crime is committed where , and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account .
but when he made that speech , what could you do to build the stronger , better society ?
how would i know what i was doing differently ?
in fact , there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains .
i just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide-angle lens .
building this system will also require a considerable investment .
the idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate , it could really stimulate innovation .
we make things grow .
a biohacker in germany , a journalist , wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street ?
this is such a new area , and as we say back in brooklyn , you ain &apos;t seen nothin &apos; yet .
matters of principle aside , practically speaking , these laws drive hiv underground .
the first is nick rhoades . he &apos;s an american .
they didn &apos;t give the forms to me or explain what was in the form .
but some countries take a harder line on this than others .
we can retool prisons so that hiv prevention and harm reduction is available to prisoners .
then , with industrialization , everything started to become centralized .
and increasingly , everything that people buy , every consumer product , in one way or another , can be personalized .
they took the elevated highway , they got rid of it , they reclaimed the street , the river down below , below the street , and you can go from one end of seoul to the other without crossing a pathway for cars .
housing is another area where we can really improve .
we think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
they &apos;re fantastic creatures .
maybe five or six people get killed by sharks every year .
and it &apos;s been suggested that basking sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change , because they &apos;re basically continuous plankton recorders swimming around with their mouth open .
we use a pole camera on the boat to actually film shark .
one thing that i think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are .
i don &apos;t understand this . i don &apos;t pretend to understand this .
and some are caught in nets , in trawls .
it was only because we had a conference on the isle of man .
and you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind .
simon berrow : how do you save a shark you know nothing about ?
in their bids to kill , i got the police on standby , and they came that fateful morning to come and kill the child .
i didn &apos;t utter a word .
many times , the prison authorities have denied ever having issues of drug abuse , issues of sodomy , so many issues they would deny that it ever happens .
aa sure . you know , undercover is all about setting the priorities right , so we got people to take me to court .
what are you into ? who are you into ?
i kept up the charade for eight years .
so four , almost five years ago , proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
so i decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
i challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but i found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
because i already am all of those things .
and apparently , he disobeyed god , and that &apos;s the ultimate disobedience to authority .
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera , they took pictures of everything . more than 1,000 .
this is the foundation of all of social science , the foundation of religion , the foundation of war .
people say , &quot; no , that &apos;s nazi germany , that &apos;s hitler , you know , that &apos;s 1939 . &quot;
&quot; sir , who &apos;s going to be responsible if something happens to him ? &quot;
interestingly , stanley milgram and i were in the same high school class in james monroe in the bronx , 1954 .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
dehumanization of others . de-individuation of self .
and since the inquisition , we &apos;ve been dealing with problems at the individual level . and you know what ? it doesn &apos;t work .
they &apos;re not prisoners , they &apos;re not guards , they &apos;re boys , and you are responsible . &quot;
the train clearance is 21 inches .
and of course , scott fitzgerald said famously that &quot; he who invented consciousness would have a lot to be blamed for . &quot;
that flow of mental images is mind .
but sometime ago , through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine , carmen puliafito , who developed a laser scanner of the retina , i found out the the following .
it &apos;s the following .
but if you consider the green part of the brain stem , nothing like that happens .
that &apos;s where the difference is .
and finally , medicine .
he &apos;s actually here today .
i co-edit , along with a collective of other super-smart , amazing women , a site called feministing.com.
it &apos;s enough to make you feel very overwhelmed .
but what they managed to do within those systems was be a humanizing force .
some attribute this golden world knowledge to plato , others to pythagoras .
it means we &apos;ve got to get out of here .
and the more focused my brain is , the more the circuit board is going to surge with energy .
they followed these little shifts in your mental activity .
this technology is intra-active .
when our productivity starts to slacken , we can go back to that data and see how we can make more effective balance between work and play .
imagine playing a video game controlled by your mind . now imagine that game also teaches you about your own patterns of stress , relaxation and focus . ariel garten shows how looking at our own brain activity gives new meaning to the ancient dictum &quot; know thyself . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i can &apos;t see this clock and i can &apos;t see the timing , so holy god , woohoo !
but he told me to believe and feel the wind in my face .
and it &apos;s frightening , isn &apos;t it ?
i just was so -- how do i tell him ?
because who am i going to be ?
and i grabbed this book off , and i &apos;m sitting on the couch going , &quot; i know what i &apos;m going to do .
but i wanted to work only and truly with business and media leadership to totally reframe disability in a way that was exciting and possible .
we are extraordinary , different , wonderful people .
if you &apos;re an upper-middle-class english person , you call unemployment &quot; a year off . &quot;
what you call them actually affects how you react to them , viscerally and morally .
what they don &apos;t say is , &quot; well the numbers all seem to add up , but before i present this idea , i &apos;ll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better . &quot;
google understood that if you &apos;re just a search engine , people assume you &apos;re a very , very good search engine .
because they think you &apos;re deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue , and &quot; why on earth should i pay to subsidize your imcompetence ? &quot;
and he used this following analogy .
choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed .
nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
and like most of you , i suspect , i don &apos;t really believe that people can see into the future .
the development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons , and this study was never published ; it &apos;s now a good example of publication bias .
we were misled , and this is a systematic flaw in the core of medicine .
first of all , we had trials registers , and everybody said , oh , it &apos;s okay . we &apos;ll get everyone to register their trials , they &apos;ll post the protocol , they &apos;ll say what they &apos;re going to do before they do it , and then afterwards we &apos;ll be able to check and see if all the trials which have been conducted and completed have been published .
but what you see here is the result of , actually , internships that we hosted with linkoping university in sweden .
we &apos;re actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-saharan planetarium in ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia .
and we started by making instruments for some of the world &apos;s greatest performers -- we call these hyperinstruments -- for yo-yo ma , peter gabriel , prince , orchestras , rock bands . instruments where they &apos;re all kinds of sensors built right into the instrument , so the instrument knows how it &apos;s being played .
music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes , movement to people with parkinson &apos;s disease .
every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument , like this chandelier . it takes up the whole stage . it looks like a chandelier , but it &apos;s actually a robotic music instrument .
i have always loved music and i am excited to be able to conduct my own music with this new software .
tm : so let &apos;s do it . so dan do you want to tell everyone about what you &apos;re going to play now ?
and he &apos;s standing on the deck of his ship , he &apos;s talking to his first mate , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; tomorrow , we will sail past those rocks , and on those rocks sit some beautiful women called sirens .
he throws the first mate to the ground .
it &apos;s off in the future . it &apos;s weak .
but despite my like for them , there &apos;s two nagging concerns that i &apos;ve always had about commitment devices , and you might feel this if you use them yourself .
and we &apos;re at a situation now where for every three baby boomers , the mckinsey global institute predicts that two will not be able to meet their pre-retirement needs while they &apos;re in retirement .
if you &apos;re like most people , just seeing that gave you a small sense of elation and joy -- just to think about making 50 percent more money in retirement than before .
whereas if the present self saves a lot , the future self is delighted , where the income is close up near 100 percent .
and i &apos;ll close it there .
this is the letter sheen , and it makes the sound we think of as sh -- &quot; sh . &quot;
it might surprise some of you here , as it did me , when i discovered that suicide is at the top of the list of the leading causes of death in young people in all countries in the world , including the poorest countries of the world .
to give you a perspective , if i had to translate the proportion of psychiatrists in the population that one might see in britain to india , one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in india .
just over 30 years ago , the nations of the world assembled at alma-ata and made this iconic declaration .
we were losing it at an extraordinary rate -- in fact , of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth of natural capital .
once again , most of that doesn &apos;t get paid .
see that again .
i think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital .
so in fact , the price of timber in the beijing marketplace ought to have been three-times what it was had it reflected the true pain and the costs to the society within china .
it &apos;s not doing too well . we &apos;ve over-issued .
let &apos;s think about it and what it means , but please , let &apos;s not do more of that .
well , not as big as his , but fairly big .
when he finished the story , i said to him , &quot; dick , i wonder what would be the difference between a feynman sandwich and a susskind sandwich . &quot;
but the amazing thing was -- feynman had to leave a little early .
the reason he called me leonardo is because we were in europe and he was practicing his french .
i don &apos;t know . maybe . who knows ?
the first one was that when helium atoms touch each other , they repel .
people were trying to do them .
thank you .
what i came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell .
all the casework is hand-scribed in , uniquely , so you can &apos;t just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand-fit .
and what i now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress .
you lay down a couple of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body , keep the blade sharp , never force it -- and these are things kids can understand and practice with .
technically the riaa can come and persecute you .
we are all aware of the risk of cancer , but there &apos;s another disease that &apos;s destined to affect even more of us : arthritis .
and the tissue &apos;s very expensive .
we &apos;re going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
they would bring them back and mount them .
instead of showing an object from the stage i &apos;m going to do something special for the first time .
ted is all about patterns in the clouds .
you see , it takes the energy in one lump of coal to move one megabyte of information across the net .
light came out of it in every direction .
you have to be kind of smart , and though i did not graduate from college doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today .
they have literally beat a path to our door .
when you listen to stereo on your home system , your both ears hear both speakers .
looked up at the ceiling of my office one day -- i was working on a ground-penetrating radar project -- and my physicist ceo came in and said , &quot; we have a real problem .
yeah , there you go .
&quot; is there a sense of wonder ? &quot;
i &apos;ve been eating cereal for breakfast all of my life .
so i do these valentines .
time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds , but without the scratches and bird shit . &quot;
but i &apos;ve come to believe that truly imaginative visual work is extremely important in society .
this happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
due to the ballbot system , it has a very small footprint and it &apos;s also easy to move around .
same with diatoms , which are shown right here , which are glasseous structures .
what all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale , and they have a dna sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures .
&quot; i have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
now if we could scale this , you could actually use it to run your prius , which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car .
so i &apos;m going to talk about work , specifically why people can &apos;t seem to get work done at work , which is a problem we all kind of have .
you almost never hear someone say the office .
you might have a quick idea , but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully , you need long stretches of uninterrupted time .
so what are these interruptions that happen at the office that don &apos;t happen at other places ?
no one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago , so why does everyone care about someone going to facebook here and there , or twitter here and there , or youtube here and there ?
what if they &apos;re doing important work ?
i have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
because work , like sleep , happens in phases .
we live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people .
ok , it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask .
and so we have these strategies to remember , and one of them was mentioned yesterday .
it could be a phone number , it could be an e-mail address , it could be a postal address .
there &apos;s a second thing i like about this .
and i know what you &apos;re asking -- did i test it ?
when everyone &apos;s connected .
there &apos;s a significant delta , in fact , between what we &apos;re willing to accept .
this poor kid , clearly a prop -- don &apos;t get me wrong , a willing prop -- but the kiss that &apos;s being documented kind of looks like it sucks .
the usual suspects , like saturated fat and sugar , nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress .
and that &apos;s johnny depp &apos;s shoulder .
until i tell you who said it .
now within that framework , we can obviously experience regret about a lot of different things .
when i went home that night after getting my tattoo , i basically stayed up all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s also a fifth one .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; reply all &quot; regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a perfectionist .
we &apos;re taught to try to live life without regret . but why ? using her own tattoo as an example , kathryn schulz makes a powerful and moving case for embracing our regrets .
and thirdly , because of the rise of non-governmental organizations .
children &apos;s medicine was 600 dollars , because nobody could afford to buy any of it .
the systems are not there to reach the people .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about our team because it &apos;s indicative of what we do .
about 40 percent of all the people who need tb treatment are now getting it -- in just 18 months , up from zero when we started .
it &apos;s worth a try and i believe it would succeed .
the desks are not square .
when the turbine drops in , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , to the green school .
local balinese women cook the food on sawdust burners using secrets that only their grandmothers know .
we need someone to come and study it .
green school is a model we built for the world .
the doctors took a fibula bone from my leg and some tissue from my shoulder to fashion into a new jaw .
i tried out various computer voices that were available online , and for several months i had a british accent , which chaz called sir lawrence . &quot;
so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice , including several audio commentary tracks that i &apos;d made for movies on dvds .
but i &apos;ve got to say , in first grade , they said i talked too much , and now i still can .
the programmers said it could assist students in their learning .
we are born into a box of time and space .
believe me , he didn &apos;t mean this as -- anyway , let me just read it .
the guy says , &quot; i want a second opinion . &quot;
20 years ago , bonnier , swedish publisher , started to set newspapers in the former soviet bloc .
the secret is that we were treating the whole newspaper as one piece , as one composition -- like music .
and then , usually after two months , we start designing .
so every year , june 16 , we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .
my left leg got caught up in the wheel well -- spun it around .
but it &apos;s hard sometimes to talk about these things , so bear with me .
i needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being , since i &apos;d been eating through a tube in my chest and through my veins .
the redundancy was actually good for me .
so i was walking around it .
this is how he wrote most of his mathematics .
it is written in mathematical language , and the letters are triangles , circles and other geometric figures , without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word . &quot;
so , i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra .
let &apos;s take the twisted six-pointed starfish .
so here is a little question for you .
let &apos;s do the reflection in x first , followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise .
and then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge , where i can rotate by 180 degrees .
but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact .
if i told you 20 or less , stand up .
let &apos;s go to 40,000 years before the present , to the time of the cultural explosion , when music , art , technology , so many of the things that we &apos;re enjoying today , so many of the things that are being demonstrated at ted were born .
in the ancient world there was a lot of respect for unintended consequences , and there was a very healthy sense of caution , reflected in the tree of knowledge , in pandora &apos;s box , and especially in the myth of prometheus that &apos;s been so important in recent metaphors about technology .
and this was an important thing about 19th century technology , that all these relationships among parts could make the most brilliant idea fall apart , even when judged by the most expert people .
so chemists got to work , and they developed a bactericide that became widely used in those systems .
and he published that book in the early 1930s , and the book still exists in further editions and is still a fundamental textbook .
you &apos;re supposed to learn this stuff how ?
i &apos;m not bitter .
and finally , it often happens that you &apos;re giving a talk , and for some reason the audience is looking at the slide instead of at you !
and once things are in a pile i can browse them by throwing them into a grid , or you know , flip through them like a book or i can lay them out like a deck of cards .
i can toss these things around . they &apos;re so much more tangible and touchable -- and you know i can double-click on something to take a look at it .
it &apos;s such an honor for me .
and i was thinking about this , of all places , on a transatlantic flight a couple of years ago , because i happened to be seated next to a hungarian physicist about my age and we were talking about what life was like during the cold war for physicists in hungary .
and he said , &quot; it &apos;s funny you ask that , because it &apos;s actually called black box trading .
you can find these kinds of things wherever you look , once you learn how to look for them .
this isn &apos;t information .
and how far can you take that ? how far can you take it ?
but i can read this map , and what this map says is that , if you &apos;re trying to make money on the markets where the red dots are , that &apos;s where people are , where the cities are , you &apos;re going to have to put the servers where the blue dots are to do that most effectively .
there &apos;s the one that cuts itself .
you know the funny thing is , i get my hands drier than people do with three or four , because they can &apos;t get in between the cracks .
roundabouts are much better .
discount that back to the present , at five percent : over two million dollars for a stop sign , in each direction .
so , now that you are all &quot; road scholars &quot; ...
so we really can make changes .
and so this leads to the paradox that because the disease is only in the poorer countries , it doesn &apos;t get much investment .
or , if you go in kind of half-heartedly , for a period of time you &apos;ll reduce the disease burden , but eventually those tools will become ineffective , and the death rate will soar back up again .
i had great teachers .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
they &apos;ve gone back and they &apos;ve gotten their master &apos;s of education .
they &apos;re team teaching . they &apos;re constantly improving their teachers .
of course , digital video is cheap now .
governments don &apos;t naturally pick these things in the right way .
so many artists speak about needing to be open , to embrace experience , and that &apos;s hard to do when you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that takes all of your focus .
jb : richard serra says that so nonchalantly , you might have missed it . he went and saw this painting by a guy who &apos;d been dead for 300 years , and realized , &quot; i can &apos;t do that , &quot; and so richard serra went back to his studio in florence , picked up all of his work up to that point , and threw it in a river .
jb : he did . he pulled in every favor he could , and got a pass into the world trade center site , where he photographed for nine months almost every day .
and i &apos;ve come to realize that we have made leadership into something bigger than us .
first day away from home , and already she &apos;s taking candy from a stranger ? ! &apos; &quot; and she said , &quot; everybody lost it . twenty feet in every direction , everyone started to howl .
we need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments , how many of them we create , how many of them we acknowledge , how many of them we pay forward , and how many of them we say thank you for .
and because we no longer need to use sunlight , we have very specialized lights that are made for the operating room .
and very often they say , &quot; you know what , points a and b are okay , but point c , you still have some residual cancer there .
however , in the presence of the tumor , now there are molecular scissors that can break this molecule apart right there at the cleavable site .
so what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer , the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery .
that &apos;s a lot of people to have a lot of problems -- and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery , which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem , and they are trying to avoid the nerves .
do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is ?
successful innovation is not a single breakthrough .
new ones are being discovered everyday .
and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix .
so all we &apos;ve got to do is take that dna , put it into a gene therapy vector , like a virus , and put it into neurons .
so to do that , we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the fiorella group , where one side of this little box , if the animal goes there , the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light .
there &apos;s no audio on this , but you can see the animal &apos;s freezing .
there &apos;s another thing , which is you &apos;ve got to get these genes into cells .
now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually , but he does a brute-force search .
so our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities .
if you look at the x-axis of this graph , you &apos;ll see that what we commonly want to do -- which is keeping the outdoors out -- we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation .
jessica green : are we filtering the wrong microbes ?
and it was a beautiful urban day , and the incredible thing about it was that the city was working .
i think that there is effectively a new kind of model of interactivity that &apos;s starting to emerge online right now .
you can also rank it by the latest posts .
so you can do kind of interesting contests .
1935 -- relief , depression , recovery banks .
and so very quickly you can accumulate a bunch of links , and it makes it more likely for newcomers to link to you in the future , and then you get this kind of shape .
what was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified .
in a filmclub season about democracy and government , we screened &quot; mr. smith goes to washington . &quot;
&quot; persepolis &quot; brought a daughter closer to her iranian mother , and &quot; jaws &quot; became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he &apos;d experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother , the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey .
purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding , that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history , or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth .
in 1962 , with rachel carson &apos;s &quot; silent spring , &quot; i think for people like me in the world of the making of things , the canary in the mine wasn &apos;t singing .
so we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work , but the question we bring to it is , how do we love all the children of all species for all time ?
this is a baby blanket by pendleton that will give your child nutrition instead of alzheimer &apos;s later in life .
now if i was a bird , the building on my left is a liability .
perhaps that &apos;s away .
and as francis crick pointed out , nine years after discovering dna with mr. watson , that life itself has to have growth as a precondition -- it has to have free energy , sunlight and it needs to be an open system of chemicals .
wear your old shoes in , your new shoes out .
now we do it by molecule . these are our cities .
and this is the concept for the top of the city .
right ? it &apos;s pretty big .
we didn &apos;t know about doublearrow .
so is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?
and the answer is , every single swedish business leader does that every single day .
because we have this thing called privacy , and if you really think that you have nothing to hide , please make sure that &apos;s the first thing you tell me , because then i know that i should not trust you with any secrets , because obviously you can &apos;t keep a secret .
her email was read , and she spoke at the united nations headquarters , and she said , &quot; if there is no right to privacy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot;
now just like the physical maps of our world that have been highly influenced by technology -- think google maps , think gps -- the same thing is happening for brain mapping through transformation .
so the outer part of that brain is the neocortex .
and on these chromosomes are roughly 25,000 genes .
there &apos;s a blade here that &apos;s going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide .
there &apos;s a container underneath that &apos;s collecting that tissue .
and each gene gives us a fingerprint .
most of you are probably familiar with genome-wide association studies in the form of people covering in the news saying , &quot; scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect x. &quot;
and so what you &apos;re looking at here in donor one and donor four , which are the exceptions to the other two , that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells .
well , here is a thought experiment for you .
sometimes the patient gets better , sometimes the patient dies .
they &apos;re not going to use them , or at least they &apos;re not going to use them as bed nets , maybe as fishing nets . &quot;
now , it &apos;s not because the vaccines are not there -- they are there and they are free -- and it &apos;s not because parents do not care about their kids .
now , a kilo of lentils is tiny .
now this is a debate that has generated a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric .
but what politicians need is a range of options .
so for every hundred dollars you spend doing that , you get 40 extra years of education .
i gave you three simple answers to three questions : give lentils to immunize people , provide free bed nets , deworm children .
i cannot tell you whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference , but can we come back here in 30 years and say , &quot; what we have done , it really prompted a change for the better . &quot;
but this is about africa , the story we have not heard .
you should have seen my parents &apos; reaction !
let &apos;s start unpacking it .
it &apos;s meaningless .
the new report , &quot; the next eleven , &quot; highlights that by 2020 nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world .
close to the mediterranean , near alexandria -- textiles , petrochemicals .
nigeria : 70 percent of roads are untarred . zambia : 80 percent .
they &apos;re doing it because they are expecting things to happen .
beauty and seduction is nature &apos;s tools for survival , because we protect what we fall in love with .
we so rarely note how different it is from moment to moment , with clouds coming and going .
and what i discovered is , because of the nature of the footage and the fact that we &apos;re doing this film , there was an emotion that was built into it and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us and all these various things .
it &apos;s what you dream about .
so i &apos;m going to just let it run , so you kind of absorb this sort of thing , and i &apos;ll describe my sort of reactions when i was looking at it for the very first time .
it was a long film to work on .
so , all i can say is , thank you , and that &apos;s my presentation for you .
you know , if you actually think about it , if somebody is totally blind -- a guy yesterday did a demonstration in one of the rooms , where people had to close their eyes and they could just hear things .
kb : second sight is whereby a mind-control expert can see through somebody else &apos;s eyes .
we &apos;re ok , though ?
can you come up ?
nicole : no .
nicole : three -- kb : like a tickling sensation ?
ok , now , in a moment , you &apos;ll feel a certain pressure , ok , and i want you to be aware of the pressure .
only when you want the pressure to go back , make a downward gesture .
excellent .
i also want you to think of his name . look at me and think of his name .
kb : ok , steve , i want you to take a seat , right behind here . excellent .
no , stay around , ok .
kb : i &apos;m over a cup , right now ?
sj : uh , neither .
i am one of the one in four . thank you .
oh , and that &apos;s not even the tip of the iceberg .
evolution did not prepare us for this . we just don &apos;t have the bandwidth , and for people who say , oh , they &apos;re having a nice day , they &apos;re perfectly fine , they &apos;re more insane than the rest of us .
and i personally am obsessed with morality .
in other words , i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .
the trick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them .
i used everything short of a drill to get oxytocin into my own brain .
so i tend to avoid that .
i &apos;ll be there and i &apos;ll give him a $ 200 reward . &quot;
one is through improper nurturing .
she had the biggest increase in oxytocin .
two weeks ago , i just got back from papua new guinea where i went up to the highlands -- very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers living as they have lived for millenia .
and you can look far back into the past , but if you look at present-day schooling the way it is , it &apos;s quite easy to figure out where it came from .
they do need to be able to read .
so i said , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot;
i gave them a speech-to-text engine in a computer , and i said , &quot; keep talking into it until it types what you say . &quot;
so i said , &quot; well , what did i expect ? &quot;
when i saw that graph i knew there is a way to level the playing field .
punishment and examinations are seen as threats .
children : you can &apos;t catch me .
there was a time when stone age men and women used to sit and look up at the sky and say , &quot; what are those twinkling lights ? &quot;
there &apos;s only one granny who manages health and safety .
and then i &apos;ll kind of be like -- -- and then they &apos;re like , &quot; whoa ! &quot;
i think of it almost like like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware of every little crazy thing your body is doing , or just aware of what you don &apos;t want it to be doing while you &apos;re playing ; you don &apos;t want to have any sudden movements .
so this story is the first of 18 chapters in my new body of work titled &quot; a living man declared dead and other chapters . &quot;
and these are studies commissioned by the zionist organization for alternative areas for jewish settlement .
during the course of this trial , all of the rabbits died , except for a few , which were euthanized .
you can also see the evolution of the one-child-only policy as it travels through the bloodline .
but it got violent in the last two decades and includes decapitation and the death of two mayors .
and this mass pile of images and stories forms an archive .
but here i &apos;m being told that the piece of music is very quick .
by holding it tightly , i feel strangely more detached .
same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
but yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
in another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
maybe i can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
we had to study from study books .
tom green : that &apos;s a 4chan thing .
there are thousands of memes that come out of the site .
it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t putting me at the top of this list ; they were actually -- it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top 21 places to spell &quot; marblecake . also , the game . &quot;
cp : you &apos;re lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now .
love and peace were mentioned .
cp : yeah . they still didn &apos;t know what to think of that though .
you want to measure it by diversity ?
so , all the other dinosaurs that you know , or your kids know , at least , on four legs .
so , 125 degrees is normal .
this was the cover of science , because they thought that humans were more intelligent than these animals , but we can see by some in our administration that despite the enormous advantage in brain volume some of the attitudes remain the same . anyway , smaller raptors .
paul sereno : let &apos;s get this tape measure on him . put it right there .
it &apos;s really an island continent .
now we have divergence over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area .
they &apos;re really kindred disciplines .
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
you give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line .
they &apos;re not doing 26 miles ; they &apos;re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and apparently without injury , without problems .
there &apos;s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .
so about seven years , eight years to reach your peak , and then gradually you fall off your peak , until you go back to the starting point .
you need a pack to pull together .
and what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things , which can make running &quot; better , &quot; called running shoes .
but maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
for me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet .
he &apos;s a scary monster .
you call your friend , she puts her handset in a robot , and , bam ! you &apos;re a mebot -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can gesture -- maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a browser and jack into a little robot .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interventions in people &apos;s homes for a period of several weeks .
but we can push this idea further .
robots touch something deeply human within us .
and i can &apos;t have my posse laughin &apos; at me .
and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
i can master shock of &quot; the crying game &quot; with the awe of a child being called an aids victim by a bully who didn &apos;t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that &apos;s a double entendre .
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image , so i got a look-alike of diana and posed her in the right positions and angles and created something that was in , or existed in , the public imagination .
well , here is the image .
so , all this work is getting shown in art galleries .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
what jack nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage and golf-clubbed a driver the other day .
has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pains , shortness of breath , sweating ?
that is something to keep in mind . we can &apos;t deal with it with situations like this .
we have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained , board certified in the usa , canada or britain .
and we will do other centers .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
we &apos;re also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs -- training people in echocardiography , cardiac ultrasound , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
and i actually feel at home here , because there &apos;s a lot of autism genetics here .
my drawings got to star in the movie too .
and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings , i showed off pictures of things .
i was really concerned about having to wear this gadget on my face .
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that .
he was now dr. carlock in the movie .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a dressmaker &apos;s shop sewing clothes .
because what i &apos;m observing is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colleges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
what are you most passionate about ?
now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
bye-bye .
and it was deep . it was deep in my soul .
now there &apos;s a talent unto itself .
and now the shore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
thank you .
the first problem is there &apos;s inadequate disaster response .
they send him to iraq .
i think it &apos;s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
what would this lead to ?
and so they invented the scientific journal as a way of synchronizing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
the programmers come and go .
this has the following effect : a programmer in edinburgh and a programmer in entebbe can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software .
right .
it was the expectation of the citizens that she would not be censored .
this one i thought i &apos;d show you .
morgan hendry : beware of safety is an instrumental rock band .
so we literally are all made out of stardust .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teeny dark dot .
okay , we have parachute aligned .
bc : we enter the martian atmosphere .
that &apos;s when we separate from the back shell , and we &apos;re now in free-fall .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our cad / cams and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about thermal properties , know about design , know about atmospheric interaction , parachutes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent , so to see , does that meet the requirement that we need .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cliff , we have a little laser system which will actually zap the rock , evaporate some of it , and actually analyze what &apos;s coming from that rock .
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
you just drive to the nearest lake , stick your hose in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
so if we start to think exponentially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there &apos;s an app for that .
you can tweet your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
how about augmenting the physician ?
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic voyage , &quot; the ipill .
in genomics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly participatory .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
the first one is dedicated to spencer , and his grandmother , who was shocked by his work .
in those days there was still countryside close to the city , farms , cornfields , cows ; even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her drunkenly stumbling , falling , sprawling , skirt hiked , eyes veined red , swollen with tears , her shame , her dishonor .
this is called &quot; thirst . &quot;
a casual impulse , a fancy , never thought of until now , hardly thought of even now ...
the girls , to my horror , averted their gaze .
c.k. williams : poetry of youth and age
samuel pisar , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot;
but images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
that was our hf radio antenna .
two norwegians did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it solo .
when the ice was flat or flattish , i could just about pull both .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach --but it worked perfectly .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sledge . did a sort of video diary piece .
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
this is probably why i didn &apos;t get into trouble about the length of my airstrip .
since then , no one has ever skied -- this was 93 years ago -- since then , no one has ever skied from the coast of antarctica to the pole and back .
but i was still concerned , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
and i remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
i do want to leave you with one positive thought .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
what would happen to our minds ?
the novelist vladimir nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments , the artistic and the scientific .
i &apos;m 43 years old right now .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
and while this was the major difference between many initiatives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was imposed on us , and people rejected that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
i remember one night when someone phoned me on my cellphone -- ordinary person who i don &apos;t know -- from tahrir square .
is this a story-of-the-year , a story-of-the-decade or something more ?
they &apos;ve had some speakers there .
and frankie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
you don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .
but it is changing the equation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decision-making .
what does that mean ?
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the glories of human existence .
and i &apos;d pull her out on the front porch .
it &apos;s called claw-hammer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it sounds something like this .
we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton .
now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work .
good news : chariot &apos;s coming .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some gunpowder for them .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this .
not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy , but there has been , historically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmos is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
and merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the culmination of that , something that &apos;s going on right now .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see .
in fact , i &apos;m finished . science will never go away .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
so i looked for furniture .
he can seat , throughout the year , he can seat 8,000 people .
what came out of it ?
there is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building .
these are some pictures visitors sent to me .
and the monkeys in that monkey forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it &apos;s not experienced the same way the world over .
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-awareness .
but i see something profoundly transformative in experiencing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
one of the -- thank you for inviting us .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
why would you do that ? why would -- it &apos;s like one step up from replying to one of those emails from nigeria , isn &apos;t it ?
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , &quot; if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible ... &quot;
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu-ca-ler . &quot;
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
and there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
they don &apos;t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .
what &apos;s interesting is the spike on the back of the dracorex was growing very fast as well .
and then , because the juveniles are in my collection , i cut them open and look inside .
here &apos;s another one .
fourth-graders love their dinosaurs , they memorize them .
so , this is just in construction , and there &apos;s a tensegrity structure .
so in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , we were mostly known for independent work , such as installation artist , architect , commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations .
it selects a point , it guides the drill to that point , it pierces the dry wall , leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location .
in this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries the intention was really to not get a climax , but to have the view stalk you , so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other .
now , that &apos;s really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats .
and for us , i mean it &apos;s really kind of a very strange thing , but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin , very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier , the walls will just exude this glow , temporarily stealing attention from the stage .
mckinley writes that the community &apos;s wondering , &quot; how could their boys have been drawn into this ? &quot;
so for her graduate work , she did a three-part series on the murder of 11 women found buried on albuquerque &apos;s west mesa .
this is its cover from november 15 , 2010 .
i never heard anyone say this about anderson cooper and his crew who were attacked covering the same story .
we need four shoulder-high plants per person , and in terms of plant care , we need to wipe the leaves every day in delhi , and perhaps once a week in cleaner-air cities .
kamal meattle : how to grow fresh air
so how do you feel about that -- the whole -- m well , it &apos;s pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing .
but i have to tell you , i have my youngest granddaughter , when she turned seven last year , said to her mother , my daughter , &quot; so what &apos;s the big deal about grandma maddie being secretary of state ?
and we lobbied on behalf of women &apos;s issues .
pm : so how do we get this balance we &apos;re looking for , then , in the world ?
three thousand years ago , civilization just getting started on the banks of the nile , some slaves , jewish shepherds in this instance , smelling of sheep shit , i guess , proclaimed to the pharaoh , sitting high on his throne , &quot; we , your majesty-ness , are equal to you . &quot;
this is michael and benedicta , and they &apos;re alive thanks in large part to dr. patricia asamoah -- she &apos;s amazing -- and the global fund , which all of you financially support , whether you know it or not .
so the pride of lions is the proof of concept .
you can join the one campaign , and leaders like mo ibrahim , the telecom entrepreneur .
might we answer that clarion call with science , with reason , with facts , and , dare i say it , emotions ?
but one , to me , that &apos;s most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development -- the output .
and what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately , is it will do a developmental computation , a molecular computation , and it &apos;ll build an electronic computer .
and i &apos;m going to draw it like this sometimes , just so i don &apos;t scare you .
when you look at dna origami , you can see that what it really is , even though you think it &apos;s complicated , is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other , and they &apos;re held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one .
and you can make a map of the americas and spell dna with dna .
and we like to draw these tiles as little squares .
you have a very sensitive computer program where small changes -- single , tiny , little mutations -- can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger .
i want you to remember that to create life &apos;s very diverse and complex forms , life uses computation to do that .
for those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea .
often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .
i propose to explore this idea further , to examine the potential of creating kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption .
and he will push us back .
so we can take their transcript and actually do some pretty cool things .
what you &apos;re getting is a range of smaller conversations , each connected to each other through the ideas and the language they share , creating a broader concept of the environment .
and we could go back to those topics and say , well , what talks are central to those conversations ?
oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons but never learn to swim , part like the red sea when the bell rings .
and he appealed to virtue .
a wise person is like a jazz musician -- using the notes on the page , but dancing around them , inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand .
so he brought it back .
fix the incentives , fix the incentives , fix the incentives ...
but too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians from improvising .
get smarter incentives .
and demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too .
ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too .
obama appealed to virtue .
they proceed to tell me a story which comes down to basically the following . we have used such advanced technologies now and made them available hills of afghanistan , iraq ...
now , i cannot imagine -- i &apos;m sorry , you may have a better imagination than i do -- i can &apos;t imagine losing my arm , and typically at 22 years old .
he &apos;s literally , he &apos;s got no shoulder on one side , and he &apos;s high trans-humeral on the other .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether the department of defense likes this arm . &quot;
if we needed this or this , what would you want ? &quot;
and they shipped him to germany and 24 hours later they shipped him from germany to walter reed .
&quot; you need to come . &quot;
i was talking to one of them , and he was really liking this arm -- it &apos;s way , way , way better than a plastic stick with a hook on it -- but there &apos;s nobody in this room that would rather have that than the one you got .
this is a time of need .
and all because he decided to walk that day .
my next pursuit was i wanted to see how long i could go without breathing , like how long i could survive with nothing , not even air .
and he said , &quot; david , you &apos;re a magician , create the illusion of not breathing , it will be much easier . &quot;
that was the one that i studied .
i &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful convulsions .
so , he suddenly pushed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds .
so , normally i would start at 38 beats per minute , and while holding my breath it would drop to 12 beats per minute , which is pretty unusual .
at 15 minutes i was suffering major o2 deprivation to the heart .
as a magician i try to show things to people that seem impossible .
mm : and that linking of the digital content to something that &apos;s physical is what we call an aura , and i &apos;ll be using that term a little bit as we go through the talk .
oh , that is so cool .
tamara roukaerts : we &apos;re ready to go .
but there &apos;s also a wonderful case for optimism .
last year , there were 85,000 riots in china , 230 a day , that required police or military intervention .
looking at the five major rivers that feed bangladesh .
last year , there were only 2,000 cases in the world .
and on april 14th , there will be step up day , where there will be a thousand individual mobilized social activist movements in the united states on protest against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming .
but , in the end , we succeeded , and the last case of smallpox : this little girl , rahima banu -- barisal , in bangladesh -- when she coughed or breathed , and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus , thus ended a chain of transmission of history &apos;s greatest horror .
but we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them .
and what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light .
so in the lower right here , you have dolly , the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in edinburgh ; ralph the rat , the first cloned rat ; cc the cat , for cloned cat ; snuppy , the first cloned dog -- snuppy for seoul national university puppy -- created in south korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo , which he had not .
and what they &apos;ve done here is they &apos;ve put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top , and it &apos;s on a big computer tracking ball .
there &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
this is where we are in this process .
it is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future .
he had seen people of different colors living in different places .
it &apos;s very destructive , but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin d in the skin , vitamin d being a molecule that we very much need for our strong bones , the health of our immune system , and myriad other important functions in our bodies .
lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once , not just twice , but probably three times .
we live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another , but often brought into proximity initially as a result of very invidious social interactions .
you can understand it .
others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
this is very rough , and this is sort of smooth , and this perfectly smooth .
so what happens is that in a way you have a much bigger lung , but it branches and branches down to distances about the same for a whale , for a man and for a little rodent .
it was very important , but mostly interesting because a kind of break , a separation between the mathematics coming from reality , on the one hand , and new mathematics coming from pure man &apos;s mind .
so he painted it , which means he put inside everything . he said : &quot; well , this thing came out ... &quot; and i said , &quot; stop ! stop ! stop !
for 50 years , people were sort of pooh-poohing me because they could do it much , much easier .
i don &apos;t want to explain these things .
i want to start on a slightly somber note .
if you &apos;re wondering why , i &apos;ll tell you why in a few seconds from now .
baba shiv : whoa !
and under what situations , when would we see this pattern of results where the passenger is going to show better , more favorable outcomes compared to the driver ?
and therefore , there are times when you &apos;re facing the inca , when the feedback is going to be immediate , negative , concrete , and you have the sense of agency , where you &apos;re far better off taking the passenger &apos;s seat and have someone else drive .
most africans today , by far , are farmers .
so why didn &apos;t agriculture markets perform to expectations ?
this made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields .
and in fact , would even dump the grain in lake michigan , rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms .
so that farmers and small traders can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call the remote access terminal centers -- and actually , without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up or any of those things , simply see the trading that &apos;s happening on the addis ababa trading floor .
ethiopia &apos;s domestic market is about one billion dollars of value .
as rocks and mountains die , grains of sand are born .
i went to sokoto in northern nigeria to try and find out how far away it is .
inside of the dunes we find shade .
so , we pushed the piles down through the dune , and we create an initial bacterial surface .
borges said that &quot; nothing is built on stone , everything is built on sand , but we must build as if the sand were stone . &quot;
i realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that i needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn &apos;t exist yet .
we &apos;re exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology .
it &apos;s the runs , the hershey squirts , the squits .
shit offends people . feces is too medical .
it &apos;s not just in the poor world that poop can save lives .
she &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
we &apos;re not going to meet targets , providing people with sanitation at this rate .
and this picture here , it &apos;s really interesting , it shows two things : first of all , it &apos;s in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far , and film was so slow in the 1960s and early 70s , you took pictures in black and white .
we hear a lot about the collapse of cod .
and the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
and in the process they use up all the oxygen , and in using up all the oxygen they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can &apos;t swim away .
think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the northwest passage .
i mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
in the summer of 1950 , enrico fermi , the italian-american physicist and atomic-pile builder , went to lunch at los alamos national laboratory and joined some colleagues there , and asked them a question : &quot; where is everybody ? &quot;
and if enrico fermi were indeed a space alien , wouldn &apos;t he be the first to have tried to convince his fellow scientists that the space aliens are not already here ?
and then his girlfriend joined in , too .
she had long , curly black hair , a blue jean jacket .
when the movie ended , everyone seemed very happy to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible .
think about it . yes . the answer is : i had a girlfriend . what ?
it took me some time to come to my senses .
an event like this leaves a scar on the memory , much like a piece of alien technology that has been inserted into your buttocks by a &quot; portuguese doctor . &quot;
and i want to ask the question -- and we &apos;ll give them that two percent hike in income , in salary each year as well , because we believe in growth .
and this , this is where it gets interesting , because it turns out that human beings have something of an appetite for novelty .
and almost straightaway we actually run up against a couple of anomalies .
&quot; what is the objective of the consumer ? &quot;
what would economies look like if we took that vision of human nature at their heart and stretched them along these orthogonal dimensions of the human psyche ?
it has social and psychological aims -- family , friendship , commitments , society , participating in the life of that society .
we &apos;re actually all happier , and a country &apos;s more beautiful , and our lives are better . &quot;
what i do in my art is i skip the canvas altogether , and if i want to paint your portrait , i &apos;m painting it on you , physically on you .
i had no idea where to begin .
but then again , i guess it &apos;s also not unforeseeable that you can find the strange in the familiar , as long as you &apos;re willing to look beyond what &apos;s already been brought to light , that you can see what &apos;s below the surface , hiding in the shadows , and recognize that there can be more there than meets the eye .
those are called the asphaltenes ; they &apos;re an ingredient in asphalt .
i am helpless over this . &quot;
the oil industry is like a huge , gigantic octopus of engineering and finance and everything else , but we actually see it in very moral terms .
and so i &apos;m not saying these guys aren &apos;t liable to answer questions -- i &apos;m just saying that , when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards , you don &apos;t actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate , or you &apos;re going to get around to really reducing the amount of oil and reducing our dependence on oil .
the only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume is much higher prices .
that was the beginning of an escalating u.s. involvement there that we do not pay for at the pump .
it comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray , and the un-useful stuff , which is called the rejected energy -- the waste , goes up to the top .
and so this -- you can see that you &apos;re paying considerably less than the health care costs on the tax .
we must go to watch &quot; afghan star . &quot;
but actually , just the opposite is happening .
and i remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers , and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know , we &apos;re made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands , and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst .
and all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice .
take some time to rest and think about things .
so anyway , who am i ?
this one is a two-bit counter .
can we get self-replicating-type behavior ?
so what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape -- the b -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
and then literally , you now pour on a monomer .
so , i &apos;m thinking about , how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things , so you end up with this sort of guy , right ?
and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that . so that &apos;s sort of another interesting aspect of the future .
basically , we substitute , in our lives , access to the things we want .
some of it is about walking . it &apos;s not all perfect yet .
these things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives .
this has led to a common understanding of our situation , namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence , and perhaps that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from , to our peril .
and , as you can see , the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths per conflict per year in this decade , as horrific as it is .
also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence in zones of anarchy , in failed states , collapsed empires , frontier regions , mafias , street gangs and so on .
the drc is a dangerous place .
what is it that you think about just before you get a condom ?
everyone knows , &quot; they say .
so we have countries living there .
you can see how the brown bubbles , which is west europe , and the yellow one , which is the united states , they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier .
so to me , as a public health professor , it &apos;s not strange that all these countries grow so fast now .
we have the high income countries here , with the united states as a leading power ; we have the emerging economies in the middle , which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout ; and we have the low income countries here .
and we have countries all this way .
and the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world .
they are moving to cities , where they also get better assistance for that .
and in spite of them having quite a high income , they have a huge number of hiv infected .
it &apos;s similar to the pellagra epidemic in mississippi in the &apos; 30s .
hans rosling : let my dataset change your mindset
this may not seem to impress , but technological evolution is progressive , so another 10 , 20,000 years , and armaments technology takes you here .
social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and to harness this productive potential , so you get cities , you know , and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don &apos;t think about that are being played across the world .
it &apos;s the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible .
it &apos;s when your welfare conduces to mine , that i decide , oh yeah , i &apos;m all in favor of your welfare . that &apos;s what &apos;s responsible for this growth of this moral progress so far , and i &apos;m saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes , and if people respond to it intelligently , we will see the development of tolerance and so on -- the norms that we need , you know .
there are people who worry about this , and in fact , i , myself , apparently , was denounced on national tv a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed i &apos;d written .
unfortunately , i personally do not believe in the marshall plan .
we need to reframe the challenge that is facing africa , from a challenge of despair , which is called poverty reduction , to a challenge of hope .
which country is that ?
the fact is no government in the world , with the exception of a few , like that of idi amin , can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule .
because they don &apos;t need to talk to their own citizens .
you need wembley stadium to host our parliament .
&quot; not good . &quot;
and i think that &apos;s terrific . i &apos;m proud of it .
and starting about six years ago , we asked about extremely happy people .
the first life is the pleasant life and it &apos;s simply , as best we can find it , it &apos;s having as many of the pleasures as you can , as much positive emotion as you can , and learning the skills -- savoring , mindfulness -- that amplify them , that stretch them over time and space .
when the first card is played , until 10 days later , the tournament is over , time stops for len .
i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that lastingly change those lives ?
and this is really what you &apos;re about . and that &apos;s our target variable .
and it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of relieving misery .
shot straight down , so these are the shadows of the camels .
and he said , &quot; oh , yeah , i remember that too !
and a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .
and most of that growth is not in the cities , but in the slums that surround them .
photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial .
and he said he was never really afraid of this .
the photo director for national geographic , david griffin knows the power of photography to connect us to our world . in a talk filled with glorious images , he talks about how we all use photos to tell our stories .
and , even more importantly , since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture , we can shoot emily in just part of an afternoon , in many different facial poses and facial expressions .
emily : image metrics is a markerless , performance-driven animation company .
but finally , i got myself involved .
it has also some beautiful primates .
but i was from the west , working in the east .
everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral , killing animals , the logging timbers and so on .
so we went to meet them .
sorry .
and i succeeded .
that &apos;s because of the language of guns .
thank you , thank you .
now this isn &apos;t because we had a public debate about whether we wanted to outsource war to private companies , but this is what has happened .
imagine that you are the head of a major school system , and someone comes to you with this proposal .
all right , what about that ?
but once we see that markets change the character of goods , we have to debate among ourselves these bigger questions about how to value goods .
they &apos;re demographics , education , debt and inequality .
you &apos;ll notice that in 1891 , over on the left , we were at about 5,000 dollars .
so that brings us down to 0.8 .
those horses also ate up fully one quarter of american agricultural land .
option a is you get to keep everything invented up till 10 years ago .
and others , like my mother , would say that i get my material from past lives .
there was a reason for everything .
and this happens constantly in the writing .
and all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response .
i was thinking that i shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if i did , it would show that i approved of the military regime there .
what are things that you get from the universe that you can &apos;t really explain ?
and i saw this beautiful place . i knew i wanted to come back .
i also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck , and fate , and coincidences and accidents , god &apos;s will , and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- i will come to some notion of what that is , how we create .
that the success of sliced bread , like the success of almost everything we &apos;ve been talking about at this conference , is not always about what the patent is like , or what the factory is like -- it &apos;s about can you get your idea to spread , or not .
the brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year .
but if the cow was purple -- isn &apos;t that a great special effect ?
this guy , lionel poilane , the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago , and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend .
there &apos;s a hot sauce otaku , but there &apos;s no mustard otaku .
they got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable .
milk , milk , milk , milk , milk -- not milk .
two years ago , i was invited as an artist to participate in an exhibition commemorating 100 years of islamic art in europe .
a group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank on a wall . it &apos;s one to one .
so a lot of economists look at declining population and expect to see stagnation , maybe depression .
and instead , they &apos;ll be planning for the future and starting to build the 22nd century enlightenment .
they only need 12 days from the moment they &apos;re born until they &apos;re on their own .
this was a small net that was being used in mexico to catch shrimp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
and with this photograph of a beautiful 15-feet , probably 14-feet , i guess , female tiger shark , i sort of think i got to that goal , where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose , and my strobe created a shadow on her face .
these are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years .
they hold on to them , and it eventually kills them .
little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .
it &apos;s not good .
still , four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people .
you also know how much labor is needed .
so how to break that cycle ?
so , just like nature , we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that , we grow the slower growing , primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity that can optimally use that light . then , what is just as important : get the right fungi in there that will grow into those leaves , bring back the nutrients to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours .
and that &apos;s green . if you look from the tower -- this is when we start attacking the grass .
if you look at rainfall , it was already up 20 percent at that time .
you also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt -- that it &apos;s transparent .
do you see how there &apos;s three peaks to the yellow sine wave ?
i have a two-year-old daughter who &apos;s the best thing ever .
and so i guess , one , the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes , and two , it does not look like as expected .
he &apos;s a very demanding person .
-- that &apos;s why when we &apos;re talking about sustainability , it &apos;s not enough , green buildings .
try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the 24 hours .
so when you start -- and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers -- it &apos;s important starting and having the contribution from people , and they could teach you if you &apos;re not in the right track .
well , i think it &apos;s a combination of two features of our intellectual culture that like to think they &apos;re opposing each other but in fact they share a common set of assumptions .
now , whenever somebody tells me that , i think , you want to see spirituality move something ?
the famous mind-body problem is that simple .
i gave you a scientific demonstration by raising my hand , but how is that possible ?
is that absolute , like force and mass and gravitational attraction ?
so it &apos;s an obvious mistake . why did they make the mistake ?
and i mean by this -- and you may say , by the way , &quot; look , i &apos;m good .
you have to go looking for them , they &apos;re not just lying around on the surface .
i love that word , &quot; disenthrall . &quot;
as she says , &quot; it &apos;s a single function device . &quot;
he said , &quot; but i wanted to be a fireman . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve achieved nothing -- commit .
if you &apos;re doing something that doesn &apos;t resonate with your spirit , five minutes feels like an hour .
and he says , &quot; i &apos;ve got something else , but it may not be for you . &quot;
like the verb &quot; to wed &quot; that you see here has become regular .
and i think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that .
but i realized that what i really needed to know i couldn &apos;t get from training courses .
and no one got killed .
but anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful .
and i think that the u.s. military is finally beginning to get this .
and it &apos;s being used by young people and older people everywhere , because it works and it &apos;s effective .
can we all just close our eyes for a minute ?
what &apos;s all the fuss about ?
can we use , in a way , a body as an empty catalyst for a kind of empathy with the experience of space-time as it is lived , as i am standing here in front of you trying to feel and make a connection in this space-time that we are sharing , can we use , at it were , the memory of a body , of a human space in space to catalyze an experience , again , firsthand experience , of elemental time .
you are now consciousness without an object , freed from the dimensionful and measured way in which life links us to the obligatory .
i once told a fortune magazine writer that someday people like me would go to jail .
in the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ; wasteful by waste-free ; and abusive by benign ; and labor productivity by resource productivity .
we &apos;ve set 2020 as our target year for zero , for reaching the top , the summit of mount sustainability .
that a is a capital a , suggesting that affluence is an end in itself .
here is what glenn wrote . and here is that person , most at risk .
depending on who you read , an arts organization or an artist , who tries to attract the attention of a potential single ticket buyer , now competes with between three and 5,000 different marketing messages a typical citizen sees every single day .
how are they entitled to practice ?
today &apos;s performers , like rhodessa jones , work in women &apos;s prisons , helping women prisoners articulate the pain of incarceration , while today &apos;s playwrights and directors work with youth gangs to find alternate channels to violence and more and more and more .
it &apos;s by astor piazzolla , an argentine composer .
and mr. ross said , &quot; you &apos;re too smart to die and i don &apos;t want it on my conscience , so i &apos;m leaving this school and i &apos;m taking you with me . &quot;
well , i think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life .
they did all right in the ketchup business .
these are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing after six months in the training program .
and this is the arts program i started in 1968 .
and i said , &quot; bill , i want to hire you , man .
and i said , &quot; you &apos;re in the computer business , is that right ? &quot;
and that worked out all right .
and i &apos;m very pleased to tell you that the building &apos;s done .
and the reason this picture &apos;s in here is i did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit , and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me .
thanks very much , and give me your card and sometime we &apos;ll talk . &quot;
and i said , &quot; if i can follow that music , i &apos;ll get out into the sunlight and i &apos;ll be ok .
it &apos;s the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness .
and so the encoder does just what i was saying : it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina &apos;s code .
so you can see that it &apos;s pretty limited , and because the firing patterns aren &apos;t in the right code , they &apos;re very limited in what they can tell you about what &apos;s out there . so you can see that there &apos;s something there , but it &apos;s not so clear what that something is , and this just sort of circles back to what i was saying in the beginning , that with the standard method , patients can see high-contrast edges , they can see light , but it doesn &apos;t easily go further than that . so what was the image ? it was a baby &apos;s face .
there is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do , but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life .
we just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
but then if you think about it , the squid has this terrible problem because it &apos;s got this dying , thick culture of bacteria and it can &apos;t sustain that .
this is the word that it talks with .
then again we turn to chemistry , and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide , this is it .
we &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
it &apos;s not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day , and that &apos;s because there &apos;s all of this chemistry going on , these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is , and what their tasks should be .
lying just beneath the surface of those arguments , with passions raging on all sides , are big questions of moral philosophy , big questions of justice .
but here &apos;s a harder question .
he had a bad leg , a circulatory problem , that made it very painful for him to walk the course .
charlie says -- we &apos;ll get charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply .
and they brought in jack nicklaus and arnold palmer .
if we had thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary , rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring , we wouldn &apos;t care about the outcome of the game .
there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics , that &apos;s a recipe for disagreement , and for that matter , a recipe for intolerance and coercion .
democracy thrives on civil debate , michael sandel says -- but we &apos;re shamefully out of practice . he leads a fun refresher , with tedsters sparring over a recent supreme court case whose outcome reveals the critical ingredient in justice .
it &apos;s a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .
what &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we &apos;re talking about intervention .
because , you know , most people , when they hear that i predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that i &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
and thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
the engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
i haven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my conclusion is that , if we can actually get suitable funding for this , then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years , but we do need to get serious about it .
however , as far as i know , all the species have evolved to actually die , so when cells divide , the telomerase get shorter , and eventually species die .
aubrey de grey : a roadmap to end aging
so let me share with you our values .
have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us ?
the final thought i want to leave with you is that i &apos;m fed up with this tyranny of either / or choices in life -- either it &apos;s men or it &apos;s women .
and probably the best example we have here in america is portland , oregon .
we have the first generation of children in america who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents .
we figure it &apos;s a natural risk of being on the road .
the carbon mapping of america , where is the co2 being emitted , for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly .
but what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more , something that would be better than what we have right now ?
in the case of the thylacine , regrettably , we shot every one that we saw . we slaughtered them .
so we thought , let &apos;s give it a go .
in those fossil rocks are some amazing animals .
but immediately , the government said , that &apos;s it , let &apos;s get rid of them , and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw .
and then the tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end .
at any rate , he led us down this bush track , and there , right where he remembered , was the hut , and tears came into his eyes .
so i thought that what may be useful is to remind us of some of the things that have gone on here , and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away , and take forward and work on .
it &apos;s important that we build this platform , that we have the president , kikwete , and others of our leaders who are saying , &quot; look , we must do something different . &quot;
so now we have this platform we can build on .
i want to tell you a little story .
i was scared because i knew her life depended on my getting to this woman .
these are people who are productive agents in the economy .
now we talk about the world bank , imf , and accountability , all that and the eu .
and we don &apos;t do it because there are so many of us . we don &apos;t coordinate .
but it can be catalytic . and if we fail to use it as catalytic , we would have failed .
but there are people -- women -- creating jobs .
i &apos;m going to start off by playing a video for you .
i think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers , and i myself , i &apos;m not going to give you many answers today , just ask a lot of questions .
and so the experiment really rests on the following : what happens in the brain during something that &apos;s memorized and over-learned , and what happens in the brain during something that is spontaneously generated , or improvised , in a way that &apos;s matched motorically and in terms of lower-level sensory motor features ?
but we have this combination of an area that &apos;s thought to be involved in self-monitoring , turning off , and this area that &apos;s thought to be autobiographical , or self-expressive , turning on .
and so what you &apos;re seeing here -- and i &apos;m doing a cardinal sin in science , which is to show you preliminary data .
this is the control condition . this is what they memorized .
but we want to get at the root of what is creative genius , neurologically , and i think , with these methods , we &apos;re getting close to being there .
and it &apos;s time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital , from the more classical , continuous mathematics , to the more modern , discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty , of randomness , of data -- that being probability and statistics .
now this is quite time consuming and isn &apos;t the most comfortable process .
but maintain that thought for the entire duration of the eight seconds .
so i &apos;d like to show you a few examples , because there are many possible applications for this new interface .
vaccination is one of the key techniques in public health , a fantastic thing .
two hundred million people a year .
and if you look through the eye , or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye , in fact , you may be able to do this directly , without drawing any blood at all , or through your nail beds .
how can you tell ?
so we thought , &quot; well , we &apos;ve done all these things that are focused on the plasmodium , the parasite involved .
mosquitoes only drink blood to lay eggs .
so this system that was built for ted is here to illustrate that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this , and we &apos;re looking very hard at how to make it highly cost-effective to use in places like africa and other parts of the world .
i basically take it , prepare it , and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it .
will they outlive me ? they probably might .
a couple of wormeries in there too .
in the canal , which is just outside the restaurant , there is hundreds of meters of coil piping .
and no one &apos;s doing that just yet .
the purpose of this project is , one : i hate not remembering things that i &apos;ve done in the past .
it &apos;s not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we &apos;re doing awesome things .
eventually , these beasts are going to live in herds on the beaches .
in fact , it &apos;s a new invention of the wheel .
so as soon it has been to the sea , it changes the pattern of zeroes and ones here , and it knows always where it is on the beach . so it &apos;s very simple brain .
we decided early on that we had to take a synthetic route , even though nobody had been there before , to see if we could synthesize a bacterial chromosome so we could actually vary the gene content to understand the essential genes for life .
and we knew , once that worked , that we actually had a chance if we could make the synthetic chromosomes to do the same with those .
and we found that 10 out of the 11 100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized were completely accurate and compatible with a life-forming sequence .
so we won &apos;t give the rest of the code , but we will give the three quotations .
also , at synthetic genomics , we &apos;ve been working on major environmental issues .
i &apos;d set aside three weeks for this project , and that , i think , is what is meant by &quot; hubris &quot; -- -- because it turned out to be three months .
&quot; some of these verses are definite in meaning , &quot; it says , &quot; and others are ambiguous . &quot;
and in particular , how the simple parts of organizations interact to create the behavior of the whole organization .
so every year , on the same day -- and it &apos;s a mystery exactly how that happens -- each colony sends out its virgin , unmated queens with wings , and the males , and they all fly to a common place . and they mate .
and it &apos;s when they reach this stable size , in numbers of ants , that they start to reproduce .
so that &apos;s what the midden workers do .
and then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce .
so , if i change the numbers performing one task , it changes the numbers performing another .
it &apos;s not due to the experience of older , wiser ants .
this is taken through a fiber optics microscope . it &apos;s down inside the nest .
so this is the kind of rule that , as the colony develops and gets older and larger , will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one .
and it continues .
the slide you &apos;re looking at here is 1990 to 2040 .
it &apos;s 25 percent cleaner than oil .
that &apos;s your concern .
tbp : that &apos;s what happened .
but if that &apos;s it and that becomes the reason that renewables don &apos;t get invested in , then , long-term , we &apos;re screwed anyway , right ?
and now i think reformers are safe .
all right , so you don &apos;t support a carbon tax of any kind or a price on carbon .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people who will want to engage with you .
and the parallels between the gold rush and the internet rush continue very strongly .
and they wouldn &apos;t let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they wouldn &apos;t come back .
now , here &apos;s where our analogy with the gold rush starts to diverge , and i think rather severely .
and they &apos;re tearing up all the streets .
i don &apos;t know why . but i thought , you know , sometimes it &apos;s just not the right time for an invention ; maybe it &apos;s time to give this one another shot .
so you know , when you were done with it , you unscrewed it .
and they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there .
so , i &apos;m going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk .
biologists call that &quot; reciprocal altruism . &quot; ok .
we say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison .
so , what do those terms mean ?
and the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness .
and politicians can be aware , and should be aware that , when people around the world are looking at them , are looking at their nation and picking up their cues for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation -- like , say , america , or any other nation -- human psychology is such that they use cues like : do we feel we &apos;re being respected ?
and it &apos;s going to take real work to change that .
and when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back , one thing and one thing only jumped out with the statistical clarity of a kind that most scientists can only dream of .
different ways of looking at her models , at her statistics , different ways of crunching the data in order to disprove her .
afraid of the conflict that that would provoke , afraid to get embroiled in arguments that they did not know how to manage , and felt that they were bound to lose .
and when he dared to speak , he discovered much more inside himself and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined .
so , let me quickly try and tell you why i thought that and how i went about it .
and let me quickly tell you some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this .
we want to make this a structure , and ask the question , how do the cells do that ?
i said , if it &apos;s true that architecture is dominant , architecture restored to a cancer cell should make the cancer cell think it &apos;s normal .
it has taken many years , but it has been very rewarding .
it &apos;s called &quot; among the school children . &quot;
now , of course , not all deception hits the news .
let &apos;s start with the butlers . here &apos;s an example of one : &quot; on my way . &quot; anybody ever written , &quot; on my way ? &quot;
now this sock puppet stuff isn &apos;t actually that new .
well , one study tested this by examining people &apos;s personalities .
it &apos;s a very old literature by now , it &apos;s coming up on 50 years .
it looks like almost every single person here recorded something .
all right , so why do i care about this ?
because in the digital age we live in now , in the networked age , we are all leaving a record .
because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
but we &apos;ve come a long way .
because i feel like , you know , there are so many images out there , so many clothes out there .
it &apos;s rarely color that i find in nature , although , you know , juxtaposed next to artificial color , natural color is so beautiful .
you know , homosexuality , right ?
and many of my friends were ballet dancers .
and that was a very , very , very big part of my process .
because just because if you &apos;re fabulously rich , and fabulously famous , does that mean you shouldn &apos;t have kids , because you know they &apos;re going to end up getting messed up ?
like i say , oh , you know , would you serve a rotten chicken ?
let me tell you something interesting .
have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decade ?
and my story , my personal story , is truly evidence for the age of behavior that i &apos;m attempting to elaborate upon here .
because the internet and connection technologies are connecting them across the world .
it &apos;s comprised of ideas and narratives and symbols and leaders .
that we have a hesitation in espousing the universality of democratic culture because we are associating that -- we associate believing in the universality of our values -- with extremists .
neoconservatism had the philosophy that you go in with a supply-led approach to impose democratic values from the top down .
that doesn &apos;t guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values .
it &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern , and television , radio , magazines , books , gave us the one-to-many pattern , the internet gives us the many-to-many pattern .
twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the us geological survey had anything up online for anybody to read .
that was enough of citizen media .
we are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
and he said essentially , &quot; i have considered the issue .
it &apos;s 29,035 feet high .
there were three other expeditions on the mountain , an american team , a new zealand team and an imax team .
and that &apos;s because everest is so high , it &apos;s in the jet stream , and winds are constantly scouring the face , so no snow gets to accumulate .
but what happened that year was the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up .
rob hall , we heard by radio , was up here , at this point in the storm with doug hansen .
the only supplies i had at that altitude were two plastic bags with preloaded syringes of painkiller and steroids .
some of them were hypothermic , some of them were frostbitten , some were both .
and beck told me that story very quietly , but i was absolutely stunned by it .
you go on to the next scan , but , in beck &apos;s case , you can see that the middle part of his brain is beginning to light up again .
a helicopter came in at 21,000 feet and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history .
and i looked at india and said , really there are four kinds of ideas which really make an impact on india .
only if the people have education , they have roads to go to work , they have lights to study at night -- only in those cases can you really get the benefit of a demographic dividend .
again , after having lived for more than 200 years under the east india company and under imperial rule , indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization believing it was a form of imperialism .
but today i believe finally infrastructure is something which is agreed upon and which people want to implement .
because of the historical indian background , in the caste system , and because of the fact that there have been many people who have been left out in the cold , a lot of the politics is about how to make sure that we &apos;ll address that .
the second thing is , the health issue .
you know if you look at the development in the west over 200 years , the average growth may have been about two percent .
and because of the rain until four o &apos;clock in the afternoon , nobody went to the polling stations .
and i &apos;ll start with what went right .
remember , until the 1970s , the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality .
the content doesn &apos;t matter anymore , the problem is the media .
and the public was extremely all for it .
now , the social impact bond is simply saying , if we can get the government to agree , that we can create a contract where they only pay if it worked .
society wins : fewer crimes , fewer victims .
the second piece it brings is rigor .
gee , that &apos;s swell . i guess you &apos;re just my fatal attraction-ie . you &apos;re my clonie . thank you .
i go , &quot; i don &apos;t know where we &apos;re going . &quot;
&quot; habibi , it &apos;s so hot . just come here for a second . say hello .
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; greetings , jack . salutations , jack . &quot;
thank you very much , tedx .
i got way too much time on my hands .
there is the inside of our lab . we haven &apos;t shown this before .
look around the room : chairs , wood , everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to lick this problem .
so you see , it &apos;s all intact , completely transparent .
it wasn &apos;t until the invention of the mr and really the integration of mr with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback -- both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive , closed-loop surgical procedure .
the only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse .
and you have to understand what is in people &apos;s mind when they are willing to take the risk .
he had metastases in his right buttock , and he couldn &apos;t sit even with medication .
and it &apos;s not just because of regulation ; it &apos;s because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .
so in conclusion , i &apos;d like to leave you with actually four messages .
the only thing that they can &apos;t copy is the actual trademark label within that piece of apparel .
this wedding dress here is actually made of sporks , and this dress is actually made of aluminum .
and this is a good thing . we need lots of options .
okay , we &apos;ll move on .
are nike t-shirts that are almost identical to one another .
and some of these industries may seem sort of marginal to you , but these are the gross sales for low i.p. industries , industries with very little copyright protection , and there &apos;s the gross sales of films and books .
and these things , because we can copy and transmit them so easily , actually circulate within our culture a lot more like ideas than like physically instantiated objects .
it wasn &apos;t until later , when i was actually back home in new york that i got the idea for the project .
so that white material that you see in between the bark and the wood is the mycelial felt of the fungus , slowly strangling the tree to death by preventing the flow of water and nutrients .
and aside from coral , the answer is no .
and it actually never sheds those leaves , so it also bears the distinction of having the longest leaves in the plant kingdom .
but what &apos;s unique about it is that it &apos;s doing dna repair below freezing .
so , every popcorn production begins with the video , and so i &apos;ve made a short , 20-second clip using a newscaster template that we use in workshops .
thank you .
the men that carried that attack out were armed with ak-47s , explosives and hand grenades .
&quot; yes , yes , yes , &quot; came the answers .
moving forward , the internet allowed things to scale even more .
the uk i know has some very strict firearms laws .
it &apos;s a great challenge for them .
actually , it &apos;s a bit more complex than that , and there are no magic bullets .
i can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are .
will i not make enough money ?
and i &apos;ve been touched by cambodian women -- beautiful women , women who held the tradition of the classical dance in cambodia .
i &apos;ve heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male .
we &apos;ve invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies , and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars into these forgotten markets .
he said , &quot; long story .
and he said to me at the end of his year , &quot; jacqueline , it was so humbling , because i thought as a farmer and as an african i would understand how to transcend culture .
is this the face of leonardo da vinci or isn &apos;t it ?
before we go into these faces , i should explain why i have some right to talk about them .
it &apos;s only proper that you here at ted hear and see it first .
then i took that pad . i want to see that . what is inside it ?
they also refused . finally , i decide , use sanitary pad myself .
that &apos;s why i am giving this machine only in rural india , for rural women , because in india , &#91; you &apos;ll be &#93; surprised , only two percent of women are using sanitary pads . the rest , they &apos;re using a rag cloth , a leaf , husk , &#91; saw &#93; dust , everything except sanitary pads .
like that , i never chased mahalakshmi .
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragile the world is .
fresh water freezes at zero .
i was hyperventilating so much , and within seconds my hands were numb .
and his hands were so badly frostbitten that he had to return to england .
i had never seen black water before .
but was it worth it ? yes , absolutely it was .
and one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff .
this is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems .
what &apos;s different is how the molecules are put together .
it &apos;s because , well , thousands of years ago , people invented ideas -- they had ideas , innovations , technology -- and the stone age ended , not because we ran out of stones .
well , they have other , little bit of advantage , but they also have some disadvantages , but the one thing they or we have is that we &apos;ve reached the point in life where we know how the story turned out .
and she said , &quot; well , something very weird was happening .
so , you know , you want energy , you want the life force , but you really want them also to think that they have a story worth sharing .
she was sort of adored on the right the way eleanor roosevelt was on the left .
and she looked at me , and it was like the successful arm-wrestle , and then , after that , she delivered an extraordinary account of what her life really was like .
so the question is : what is the key that &apos;s going to allow this to proceed ?
at the time that i proposed to her that -- by the way , i would have proposed to her ; she was extraordinary -- but proposed to her that she come on .
and secondly , she had better be , although she did dance for a while , a choreographer because then her looks didn &apos;t matter .
so this seemed like a problem that we could do something about .
and i have to ask the question -- vc &apos;s always ask , &quot; sir , what is your business , and who is your customer ? &quot;
how is this a hard problem ?
they &apos;ve treated 50,000 kids in vietnam with this technology .
you think it &apos;s funny .
because there is this asymmetry , which creates , basically , failing governance .
no , we are talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank accounts , on the bank accounts of liechtenstein , of the president &apos;s ministers , the high officials in the para-statal sectors .
we had here in berlin , at the aspen institute on the wannsee , we had sessions with about 20 captains of industry , and we discussed with them what to do about international bribery .
this is , under german law , allowed , and the members of our parliament don &apos;t want to change this , and this is why they can &apos;t sign the u.n. convention against foreign bribery -- one of they very , very few countries which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world , but not able to ratify the convention , which we managed to get on the books with about 160 countries all over the world .
instead , i &apos;m thinking about that cup of coffee i desperately need to wake me up .
there are three paintings i &apos;m going to show you now that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks and want to tell stories about them .
for one thing , in dutch painting of the time , if a woman &apos;s mouth was open , it was indicating sexual availability .
so clearly , her clothes were lent to various different women .
i &apos;m thinking of an older version of himself .
and i thought , if i &apos;m going to make a story , what &apos;s the last thing i &apos;m going to put in there ?
i know , i could barely utter them .
then came bollywood .
here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do , and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me .
they can afford to watch their &quot; robocop &quot; and whatever .
but we can do something too .
roboger animadu : in big countries , when they do the movies , they have all these things in place .
and so it &apos;s a very , very important thing for them , and for their audiences .
so this is what i really think .
so it &apos;s safe to say that there are 2,000 films .
i &apos;m almost like a crazy evangelical .
and jonathan jones is making it happen .
even in the 1930s , my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art .
i &apos;ve never made it into a planet , but that &apos;s it .
we have street fighter ii , because martial arts are good .
the real core issue of interaction design is behavior .
and it &apos;s too long to explain the acquisition , but if you want to go on the moma blog , there &apos;s a long post where i explain why it &apos;s such a great example of design .
and we continue to work with this client .
i was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed .
and when i got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail .
p for palladio .
then jay chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in venice , and i started with this three-piece thing , and you entered in the middle .
i mean , it &apos;s kind of a trite thing to say , but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be , where the people would come and where the people working would interact .
and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .
and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake .
i keep trying to make it work .
and a long time ago , about &apos; 82 or something , after my house -- i designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left .
this is the bedroom .
this is in paris , along the seine .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
and i don &apos;t gave good slides to show -- it &apos;s just been completed -- but this piece here is this building , and these pieces here and here .
but everybody liked these forms and liked the space , and so that &apos;s one of the problems of a competition .
i just stuck it on there .
before he was a legend , architect frank gehry takes a whistlestop tour of his early work , from his house in venice beach to the american center in paris , which was under construction when he gave this talk .
you &apos;ll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree , cut it down and make charcoal out of it .
after some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln , and then you end up with this carbonized material here .
so we went back to mit , we took out the instron machine , and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it ?
people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products .
we need to work with the people in these communities , and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems . that &apos;s the best way to do it .
but also imagine if they were filled with solid bone -- our head would be dead weight , we wouldn &apos;t be able to hold it erect , we wouldn &apos;t be able to look at the world around us .
she &apos;s also in danger , when she damages this , of bleeding profusely .
she wasn &apos;t miserable at all .
i don &apos;t say he overcame this ; he didn &apos;t overcome it .
if you do cosmetic surgery , patients are often less happy .
so we &apos;ve talked about the static face and judging the static face , but actually , we &apos;re more comfortable with judging the moving face .
so with modern technology , we used computers to make models .
just imagine , i can make a biologically-degradable template .
and i &apos;ll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it .
we are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day .
what goes in is what we are .
it &apos;s because of the way the government commodifies food , and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really , really cheap .
we really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe .
they also may be growing them . and we serve them in the cafeterias .
i work with private companies who are willing to do r &amp; amp ; d with me , who are willing to do distribution for me , who are really willing to work to go into schools .
but we really have to educate .
now i don &apos;t know about you , but i go to starbucks and pete &apos;s and places like that , and venti latte in san francisco is five dollars .
that &apos;s part of you up there .
and i get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think , &quot; that &apos;s impossible ! you can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot;
now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
so this is the problem . so i have to do a little bit of the sort of work that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a magic trick explained to you .
we &apos;re looking for a backer .
and i noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge .
how many of you rotated the one on the right ? ok .
as a cube , on a black background , as seen through a piece of swiss cheese .
so now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
what i wanted to show you is that scientists , using their from-the-outside , third-person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .
they &apos;re essentially , to a point , attempts at planning what other people should do , planning their life for them .
now , that &apos;s also wrong , because traffic happens to be a nonlinear phenomenon , meaning that once you reach above a certain capacity threshold then congestion starts to increase really , really rapidly .
but what happened when the congestion charges were there is not what you would expect , that people hated it more and more .
it &apos;s an unfortunate reality in nearly every major city — road congestion , especially during rush hours . jonas eliasson reveals how subtly nudging just a small percentage of drivers to stay off major roads can make traffic jams a thing of the past .
these are opium-addicted people on the roofs of kabul 10 years after the beginning of our war .
so when you hear what i &apos;m going to talk about here today , first of all , i want to say that i am here on behalf of all the patients that i have ever met , all the ones i haven &apos;t met .
and when the web came along , that changed everything , because not only could we find information , we could find other people like ourselves who could gather , who could bring us information .
so i went in for an ultrasound .
well , so what i read on webmd : &quot; the prognosis is poor for progressing renal cell cancer .
because if you wonder why patients are motivated and want to help , think about this .
you see , that &apos;s the immune system .
and it goes like this .
so she took it .
when dave debronkart learned he had a rare and terminal cancer , he turned to a group of fellow patients online -- and found the medical treatment that saved his life . now he calls on all patients to talk with one another , know their own health data , and make health care better one e-patient at a time . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so i &apos;d like you to image a mining industry in a way that one hasn &apos;t existed before ; imagine a mining industry that doesn &apos;t mean defiling the earth ; imagine bacteria helping us do this by accumulating and precipitating and sedimenting minerals out of desalination brine .
now , what i mean by echolocation -- they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose . this sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment , and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image .
the chinese word for &quot; bat &quot; sounds like the chinese word for &quot; happiness , &quot; and they believe that bats bring wealth , health , longevity , virtue and serenity .
and one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases , or does this variation just make you different ?
as we age , we deteriorate , and this deterioration causes problems for our society , so we have to address it .
in western society , bats are often characterized as creepy , even evil . zoologist emma teeling encourages us to rethink our attitude toward bats , whose unique and fascinating biology gives us insight into our own genetic makeup . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , what did you do , last time you got serious ?
the commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money into many , though not all , of the countries of the bottom billion .
so , what goes wrong ? why is there this &quot; resource curse , &quot; as it &apos;s called ?
and so , what the countries of the bottom billion need is very strong checks and balances .
just in time , a set of economists got there and said , &quot; why not try an auction ? it &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
around the world right now , one billion people are trapped in poor or failing countries . how can we help them ? economist paul collier lays out a bold , compassionate plan for closing the gap between rich and poor .
surgeons are not made either .
this is allan okrainec from toronto .
this past year i &apos;ve been in latin america , i &apos;ve been in china , talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery .
more to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place .
steven schwaitzberg : a universal translator for surgeons
i liked the fine detail it gave my work , but i wanted to make them larger -- to shift from being an object you look at to something you could get lost in .
i want to create these oases of sculpture in spaces of cities around the world .
i &apos;ll leave you with this story .
so whenever i fill up my gas , i think of that liter , and how much carbon .
but now , we have a real technology to do this .
as they do it , in the upper left is a display that &apos;s yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
they are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
and so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience , psychology , etc .
the concept of physical health is undefined .
now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
but the demagogues are right about one thing : we need a universal conception of human values .
that is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face -- i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
questions of good and evil , right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science . but sam harris argues that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues , shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life .
you see the mother in between and two daughters , probably on the left and right , and a single egg on the right-hand side .
and after a few days , depending upon temperature , the egg will hatch and the larva of this parasite will eat the aphid from the inside .
but again , the question is , here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest , the natural enemy .
why good bugs ?
so i think my last slide is : all we are saying , we can actually sing it : give nature a chance .
i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter , so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject .
the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody . i do a lot of that .
urban absurdism -- that &apos;s what the new yorker really calls for .
and then when it ran , a lovely lady , an old lady named mrs. edgar rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover , it was so sweet .
the fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies .
how could the easter islanders have deforested their environment ?
in particular , what can all of us do ? for those of you who are interested in these choices , there are lots of things you can do . there &apos;s a lot that we don &apos;t understand , and that we need to understand . and there &apos;s a lot that we already do understand , but aren &apos;t doing , and that we need to be doing . thank you .
so insects , just for free , contribute to the economy of the united states with about the same order of magnitude , just for free , without everyone knowing .
tomato soup , peanut butter , chocolate , noodles -- any processed food that you &apos;re eating contains insects , because insects are here all around us , and when they &apos;re out there in nature they &apos;re also in our crops .
and if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
you get a new disease that can be deadly .
so that &apos;s four points for insects .
well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
marcel dicke : it &apos;s all protein .
and being the youngest of seven , i have never been at the front of the line for anything . ok ?
&quot; after you . &quot; &quot; oh , no , no . after you . &quot;
and you know , when he walked in , i could just tell that he saw them .
and it was a device that , in fact , is a model of the sky .
and so , this astrolabe is on loan from us from the oxford school of -- museum of history .
step three is identify the star on the front of the device .
and it would take a full university course to illustrate it .
knowing the sky , knowing your relationship with the sky , is the center of the real answer to knowing what time it is .
we call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion .
so , in this video we &apos;re using an approach called the reactive approach .
so , this is actually based on that . this robot is called mars : multi-appendage robotic system . so , it &apos;s a hexapod robot .
we developed these novel actuators for joints .
so , based on that success , the following year we did the proper mechanical design starting from kinematics .
so , this is for the best humanoid , and we would like to bring this for the very first time , to the united states next year , so wish us luck .
and then i think , &quot; ah this is cool . &quot;
he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .
so this is bertie county , north carolina , usa .
the county seat is windsor .
it &apos;s about designing with people , and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within .
this is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we &apos;re building schools out of these days .
so for us , this was a graphic public campaign called connect bertie .
they &apos;re paid as employees of project h to be the construction crew with us to build these projects in the community .
and i really , strongly believe in the power of the small story , because it is so difficult to do humanitarian work at a global scale .
about two thirds , i would guess , of the world is desertifying .
so our government formed a team of experts to evaluate my research .
and watch the change as it goes into this long dry season .
so rather than reinvent the wheel , i began studying other professions to see if anybody had .
we now have in the violent horn of africa pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature and openly saying it is the only hope they have of saving their families and saving their culture .
allan savory : how to fight desertification and reverse climate change
so , to implement these twin missions , a few years ago , i launched project prakash .
in fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s indicated in the green outlines .
the one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information .
so , given that kind of video input , with just about six or seven minutes worth of video , dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces .
ss : aimee and i thought we &apos;d just talk a little bit , and i wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete .
and so i decided to give this a shot : heart pounding , i ran my first race and i beat the national record-holder by three hundredths of a second , and became the new national record-holder on my first try out .
you can run with our women &apos;s track team . &quot;
am : no , a year .
i wanted to find out times .
all this training -- i had transformed my life .
you can be eight feet tall . just take them off . &quot;
moderator : aimee and the designer of them will be at tedmed 2 , and we &apos;ll talk about the design of them .
we &apos;re an hour before the espys , and she thought she &apos;d gotten a two-inch heel but she &apos;d actually bought a three-inch heel .
but it &apos;s also a morally important one .
now when this law first passed , the world &apos;s hottest mp3 player could hold just 10 songs .
it &apos;s done by geologists , engineers , biologists , all sorts of different people -- modeling and simulation .
turn it from that into some answer in a mathematical form .
that &apos;s an amazing amount of human endeavor .
basics of what ?
and what &apos;s worse , what they &apos;re learning there isn &apos;t even practically useful anymore .
it &apos;s called programming .
and by the way , she was also very insistent on being able to change the color , an important feature for this demonstration .
no , what i &apos;m suggesting is that we should leap off , we should increase our velocity so it &apos;s high , and we should leap off one side and go the other -- of course , having calculated our differential equation very carefully .
who knows , maybe she was volunteering for service .
as an architect , that stark juxtaposition of my sighted and unsighted experience of the same places and the same cities within such a short period of time has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights of the city itself .
but one time i was in oakland walking along broadway , and came to a corner .
in fact , i &apos;ve heard it said in the disability community that there are really only two types of people : there are those with disabilities , and there are those that haven &apos;t quite found theirs yet .
so , i work for esquire magazine , and a couple of years ago , i wrote an article called &quot; my outsourced life , &quot; where i hired a team of people in bangalore , india , to live my life for me .
so , not very .
the bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers , so i thought , &quot; sounds strange , but i &apos;ll try it . &quot;
it happened -- i was in the park , and i was dressed in my biblical clothing , so sandals and sort of a white robe , you know , because again , the outer affects the inner .
and my wife thought this was very offensive , so she sat in every seat in our apartment , and i had to spend much of the year standing until i bought my own seat and carried it around .
so , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a god .
and i would say , &quot; but that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
a.j. jacobs : my year of living biblically
computers and the programming languages that we talk to them in , that we teach them in , are hideously insensate when it comes to space .
here , the real world merges with the simulation .
and , using a hand , we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom , six degrees of navigational control .
and one thing that &apos;s very important is to combine traditional tabular data with three-dimensional and geospatial information .
and again , that stuff needs to be undertaken in the context of space .
ju : no , it has to be for every human being .
&amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; minority report &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; science adviser and inventor john underkoffler demos g-speak -- the real-life version of the film &apos;s eye-popping , tai chi-meets-cyberspace computer interface . is this how tomorrow &apos;s computers will be controlled ?
and the interesting moment now , the number of environments where the social design challenge relies on both of those things being true .
and once they &apos;ve done it , they can do it again , and they could work on getting it better .
if you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late , we &apos;re going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill .
it &apos;s value created by the participants for each other .
it &apos;s got everything that you &apos;d want a normal soap opera to want : it &apos;s got love , joy , happiness , sadness , tears , laughter , lots of deceit , intrigue .
as you can see , you can play anywhere .
just as england invented cricket , and made the rest of the world play it .
it was a new thing for us . we had only ever supported our country -- the only two areas in which india was very proud about their country , representing itself on the field .
so , just to give you an example of how they did it -- not manchester united style promotion , but very mumbai style promotion . take a look .
and so it started resembling the indian movies more and more .
hb : suddenly , a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day -- so 250 rupees for a test match , but if you finish in four days you only got 200 .
there &apos;s no filth , there &apos;s no beggars , all the snake charmers have vanished , everybody &apos;s gone . this tells you how the capitalist world rules .
now , let me talk about the first one first .
two things are vastly underestimated : dying by drowning and dying by asthma . why ?
now , a slightly different version of this lottery : imagine that the nine tickets are all owned by one fat guy named leroy .
because they had the sense that declining wages are worse than rising wages , even when the total amount of wages is higher in the declining period . here &apos;s another nice example .
in both cases , it was a piece of paper .
in fact , these items that are sitting in the room change how much the subjects think they &apos;re going to enjoy the potato chips .
and at some point you may have met a couple from your own hometown , and you thought , &quot; oh , my god , these people are so warm . they &apos;re so nice to me .
maybe that isn &apos;t so remarkable , but what is remarkable is how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that &apos;s 12 months -- or 60 dollars in 13 months .
watch what happens when we drop some out .
we already know , for example , in the united states , more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes -- because they were scared -- and driving on highways , than were killed in 9 / 11 . ok ?
dg : yes , of course . so , if we knew that this was the worst attack there would ever be , there might be more and more buses of 30 people -- we would probably not be nearly so frightened .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s quite as specific a mechanism as the one you alluded to , but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it .
dg : ah , for you in persuading them .
and this is battista .
sometimes , in the middle of a resistant problem , i write down things that i know about it .
i am now exposing myself to my audience , right ?
the other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one ; you get the big one and if you don &apos;t like that , how about the little one ?
the shadow of magritte falls across the central part of the poster a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word &apos; hat , &apos; hidden in the word &apos; whatever . &apos; the four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined : as a thing itself , the worth of the thing , the shadow of the thing , and the shape of the thing .
take the emotion of fear , for instance . it keeps us away from doing things that are really , really risky .
jews , women , homosexuals , untouchables , lower-class people -- all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body . &quot;
so it not only predicted self-reported political orientation , but actual voting behavior . and also we were able , with this sample , to look across the world , in 121 different countries we asked the same questions , and as you can see , this is 121 countries collapsed into 10 different geographical regions .
the question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex , and might depend on exactly what judgments we &apos;re talking about , and as a scientist , we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions .
i have this feeling i &apos;d be happy there .
boy : oh , marcus , you know what i mean .
the first piece was , really , there &apos;s a young woman talking about nigeria , that she has a feeling she &apos;ll be happy there .
child soldiers : ready and willing to die .
various voices : we don &apos;t need no more trouble no more trouble they killed my mother .
we don &apos;t need no more ... committee chairman : we hope that , with your help and the help of others , that this commission will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war .
ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before ?
eo : thank you .
but one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics .
mm : thank you .
and that &apos;s one of the great dilemmas -- we &apos;re in a creativity session -- it &apos;s one of the great dilemmas in creativity : how to do work that &apos;s big enough and not sell out .
back to -- everything &apos;s so temporary .
i just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on ground zero i think for a long time .
i just stopped .
what &apos;s the schedule , richard ?
the mit project -- they were interviewing me for mit and they sent their facilities people to bilbao .
bilbao , i think , shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city .
we sat down , and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet .
in a wildly entertaining discussion with richard saul wurman , architect frank gehry gives tedsters his take on the power of failure , his recent buildings , and the all-important &quot; then what ? &quot; factor .
and that got me to go out and look at mines like this , and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions in the landscape that i could find .
it was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me , and it caught fire about four years ago . it &apos;s around westley , california , around modesto .
i came out of a blue-collar town , a gm town , and my father worked at gm , so i was very familiar with that kind of industry and that also informed my work . but you know , to see china and the scale at which it &apos;s evolving , is quite something .
this is the town hall for the city .
they &apos;re called dengzahoos -- they &apos;re like pin tacks to the ground .
and when you start looking at that , and then you start factoring up into a city the size of shanghai , it &apos;s literally a forest of skyscrapers .
it wasn &apos;t too bad , but they &apos;re driven to produce these things at an incredible rate .
they make coffeemakers here , the biggest coffeemaker and the biggest iron makers -- they make 20 million of them in the world .
and it isn &apos;t something that isn &apos;t just affecting our world , but it starts to go up -- because i think we can start correcting our footprint and bring it down -- but there &apos;s a growing footprint that &apos;s happening in asia , and is growing at a rapid , rapid rate , and so i don &apos;t think we can equalize it . so ultimately the strategy , i think , here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution , because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well .
and this one is : i wish to launch a groundbreaking competition that motivates kids to invest ideas on , and invent ideas on , sustainability .
and i think there &apos;s a real possibility to reach new audiences if i had a chance .
and it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
they have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
this is the last frontier of recycling .
even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
thank you for your time .
and having thought about this a little bit , i see a couple different possibilities .
the good news about holly though is that she doesn &apos;t actually have the same kinds of technologies we do .
it doesn &apos;t look like much -- in fact , it isn &apos;t like much .
you might have them start paying attention to price , paying attention to how much they buy -- sort of keeping track of their monkey token , as it were .
so much so that , if you saw the monkeys &apos; numbers , you couldn &apos;t tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market .
i &apos;m just going to give you 500 bucks .
well , it turns out that this seems to be the result of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level .
all the time , he adds one , to give the monkeys two .
the remarkable thing to us is that , when you give monkeys this choice , they do the same irrational thing that people do .
you know , think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things , fatty things like cheesecake .
laurie santos : a monkey economy as irrational as ours
now , one in three people living in cities today actually live in a slum .
mass timber panels are those 24-dot bricks .
and the way i describe it is this .
we were running windows 2000 .
sure , we invest plenty in innovation . we invest in broadband and science education and science grants , but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have .
created after the post-election riots in kenya in 2008 , this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able to crowdsource and target the delivery of better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble , whether it &apos;s after the earthquakes in haiti , or more recently in italy .
simply throwing data over the transom doesn &apos;t change how government works .
words like equality and fairness and the traditional elections , democracy , these are not really great terms yet .
so , at the table at 915 , i learned something about compassion .
we &apos;re all strands in it .
i allowed my anger , my bitterness , my grief to simmer a while , and then i made up my mind that i was going to make a different world , and we can do that together . &quot;
and then the person asked , &quot; well , what do you mean , &apos; neighbor ? &apos; &quot; and he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves , and how religious authorities went the other way , and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way ; but an unsuspecting , despised person came along , saw the man in need , provided oil and wine for his wounds , put him on his own transportation , and took him to the inn and asked the innkeeper , &quot; take care of him . &quot;
and if mama eternal has taught us correctly , this song will make sense , not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering , but to all who sign the charter for compassion .
and it &apos;s synonymous with free speech , even if you &apos;re not sure what it is that you have to say .
and around that space , the ring is actually galleries .
so this is the big idea .
it &apos;s about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air .
this is a point cloud .
i &apos;m doing this because of an old lady in my village now , who have lost her children .
it was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system , and using religion to get what they want to get out of us , which is the oil , the diamond , the gold and the land .
never give up . never give in .
my country is war-torn .
and i almost broke my leg dancing to his music .
and so , the importance of education to me is what i &apos;m willing to die for .
but i &apos;ll ask you guys to stand up so we celebrate the life of a british aid worker called emma mccune that made it possible for me to be here .
and so , he was destined to be raised by a single mom , which might have been all right except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic , and when will was five years old she tried to kill him with a butcher knife .
others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients , sometimes by years , sometimes by months .
that &apos;s the first thing i &apos;ve learned .
what we &apos;re talking about today is also rocket science .
they had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison , they had to establish strict separation between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities , and most dauntingly of all , they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what ?
we &apos;re going to devote enormous social resources to punishing the people who commit those crimes , and that &apos;s appropriate , because we should punish people who do bad things .
and my dad said , &quot; yeah , but , honey , i think that &apos;s technically just between thanksgiving and christmas . &quot;
and she said , &quot; listen . the cut-off date to start kindergarten was september 15 . &quot;
and i sat them down , and i got them glasses of water -- ok , i got it . i got them glasses of water .
and they said , &quot; well , they became our native americans here in the u.s. &quot;
would god force you to get your old nose back ?
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .
he &apos;d be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being .
it thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .
maybe some of you have .
another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
now that &apos;s all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves .
keep building them .
and so i think it &apos;s really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth .
and this is , i think , the predicament of our lives : that we don &apos;t take every opportunity to help because our focus is in the wrong direction .
here at ted there are great opportunities .
we &apos;re all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot .
and we found out that he was hispanic , he didn &apos;t speak any english , he had no money , he &apos;d been wandering the streets for days , starving , and he &apos;d fainted from hunger .
so here i was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness .
the metaphor of mahishasura mardhini , of durga .
renowned classical indian dancer ananda shankar jayant was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 . she tells her personal story of not only facing the disease but dancing through it , and gives a performance revealing the metaphor of strength that helped her do it .
it &apos;s difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then .
well , documents you read , ok ?
interestingly , data is relationships .
data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms .
tim berners-lee : can you say &quot; data &quot; ?
but , that &apos;s not true .
and we &apos;ve practiced that .
and combined , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
could they come together and help the millennium development goals get rebranded into the millennial generation &apos;s goals ?
now sure , progress in china and india and poverty reduction there was key to that , but recently also in africa , poverty rates are being reduced .
jamie drummond : let &apos;s crowdsource the world &apos;s goals
i think you should study in a school of art .
this is the trace of fire , this is the trace of sun .
or buddha -- if he saw the same cow , he would say , &quot; asking this question denies your own nature &#91; as a &#93; cow . &quot;
it &apos;s a full-figure cast from myself .
so this is after a few weeks , this is after a few months .
that evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture &#91; the &#93; invisible .
this is called &quot; gravity . &quot;
now clearly , david livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time , but it does seem useful to ask ourselves , &quot; just how global are we ? &quot;
so clearly , apocalyptically-minded authors have overstated the case .
he &apos;s clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
when you ask people in france what percentage of the french population is immigrants , the answer is about 24 percent . that &apos;s their guess .
so i developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
it &apos;s the same with brands : the more massive a brand , the more baggage it has , the more force is needed to change its positioning .
so next , the scientific method -- an axiom of physics , of all science -- says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation , you can only disprove it .
it &apos;s out of your control .
it &apos;s also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique .
of course , there are the bases , which refer to specific sexual activities that happen in a very specific order , ultimately resulting in scoring a run or hitting a home run , which is usually having vaginal intercourse to the point of orgasm , at least for the guy .
that &apos;s just not the way it happens .
and even if you &apos;ve had pizza with somebody for a very long time , don &apos;t you still say things like , &quot; should we get the usual ? &quot;
and we get to decide when we feel satisfied .
i think our ancestors -- i think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
as one businessman in new york said to me , he said , &quot; anything she liked , i liked . &quot;
so we scanned their brains , looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph , with a distraction task in between .
it can be focused on nobody .
and it &apos;s going to have an impact .
they &apos;ve got incredible people skills , negotiating skills .
they &apos;re now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the &quot; symmetrical marriage , &quot; or the &quot; pure marriage , &quot; or the &quot; companionate marriage . &quot;
but these three brain systems : lust , romantic love and attachment , aren &apos;t always connected to each other .
not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit , but they kill the sex drive .
i &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
that wasn &apos;t being asked .
three years later , i found out how wrong i was .
i know it sounds crazy because we &apos;re obviously in the midst of an obesity epidemic , but hear me out .
so if you can be obese and not have insulin resistance , and you can be lean and have it , this suggests that obesity may just be a proxy for what &apos;s going on .
first , this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer .
as a young surgeon , peter attia felt contempt for a patient with diabetes . she was overweight , he thought , and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation . but years later , attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder : is our understanding of diabetes right ? could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity , and not the other way around ? a look at how assumptions may be leading us to wage the wrong medical war .
but my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of the ford motor company was to make people &apos;s lives better and make cars affordable so that everyone could have them .
and the good news is today we are tackling the big issues , of cars and the environment -- not only at ford , but really as an industry .
so , if we make no changes today , what does tomorrow look like ?
they &apos;re relieving congestion , and they &apos;re frankly starting to save some fuel .
but we need people like all of you in this room , leading thinkers .
so , bringing together the small to help facilitate and create the big , i think , is something that we believe in -- something i believe in , and something that we kind of bring to life through what we do at ideo .
they said , ok , it &apos;s not about systemic change .
and finally , for the brits , percy shaw -- this is a big british invention -- saw the cat &apos;s eyes at the side of the road , when he was driving home one night and from that came the catseye .
why do we all follow the line in the street ?
sort of having beginner &apos;s mind , scraping your mind clean and looking at things afresh .
they &apos;re now called kickstart .
even in the times of h1n1 , i like the word .
and once that happened , they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished .
they are playing , all free , for all children .
look at what their parents says .
last i heard , the preamble still said , &quot; we , the people of india , &quot; right ?
they were filled with a kind of pioneering passion , fired about the problems of the aral sea .
it &apos;s only the beginning of the problem .
how does it affect the design of buildings ?
in other words , we didn &apos;t have the technology to do what would be really interesting on that building .
for wind tunnels , we would literally put them in a wind tunnel and blast air , and the many kilometers of cable and so on .
you can measure it again .
what if it is the equivalent , depending on where you are , of the grand canal , in terms of tourists , habitation , desalination , agriculture ?
and i voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year , i thought that the inspiration was more likely to come from those other , larger countries out there -- the chinas , the indias , the asian-pacific tigers .
they allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way .
it could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds and lights up a patch of the land , highlighting it compared to the dim environment .
it is the place where we gather around when we have to say something to each other .
so that is a really interesting proposition , i think , and a new way of lighting the architectural environment with our well-being in mind .
like here -- this is a very low light level actually .
by appreciating the darkness when you design the light , you create much more interesting environments that truly enhance our lives .
is it that i articulate very well ?
or of indian councils of science research do not require that whatever you learn from people , you must share back with them .
we should be doing something about it .
and it all begins with curiosity .
if we can create markets for these artists , we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones .
now , what we need is , we need people who will be able to scale them up .
in the scaling up , there &apos;s an inherent inadequacy to match the needs of the local people , point by point , with the supply that you &apos;re making .
ag : saidulluh sahib is in motihari , again in champaran .
and we have a very vibrant network in china , particularly , but also emerging in brazil and other parts of the world .
he said , &quot; i can &apos;t . this is the only thing i know , but i &apos;ll invent a machine , which will solve your problem . &quot;
i would love to talk about the technology , and sometime , in what &apos;s past the 15 minutes , i &apos;ll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what &apos;s in here .
150 years ago , locomotives got efficient enough , steam power , that we turned the continent into a country .
or skiing . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to move around doing fun things .
he agreed . we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat , carrying 70 pounds of stuff . they love it .
we &apos;ve got to show them this thing .
but , in any event , if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it &apos;s external combustion -- as your kitchen stove , if you can burn any fuel , it turns out to be pretty neat .
in december of 2010 , the city of apatzingán in the coastal state of michoacán , in mexico , awoke to gunfire .
whether we like it or not , the u.s. is the largest market for illegal substances in the world , accounting for more than half of global demand .
you see , los zetas is not just this random assortment of individuals , but was actually created by another criminal organization , the gulf cartel , that used to control the eastern corridor of mexico .
finally , the sinaloa federation .
the question is whether we are willing to continue our support of a failed strategy based on our stubborn , blissful , voluntary ignorance at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young .
and that &apos;s one way that we try to time technology trends .
you can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the vcr .
this is a fascinating research from who that shows the effect of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails .
voice over ip is something you may have heard something about .
india had , still has , a regulated phone system and so did we .
and their policy prescription is to make government more accountable , focus on the capital markets , invest , don &apos;t give anything away .
in 2002 i met this incredible entrepreneur named amitabha sadangi from india , who &apos;d been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet .
and while , again , you needed patience to move a technology for the poor in india into pakistan , just to get the permits , over time we were able to start a company with dr. sono , who runs a large community development organization in the thar desert , which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country .
and if we take that notion of a global innovation fund , we could use this time to invest not directly in government , though we would have government &apos;s blessing , nor in international experts , but in the many existing entrepreneurs and civil society leaders who already are building wonderful innovations that are reaching people all across the country .
we asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons .
jacqueline novogratz : a third way to think about aid
he makes enough money , just by running ads , to support his family up in oregon .
and i said to my husband , i said , &quot; ben , can i buy a banjo ? &quot; and he &apos;s like , &quot; no . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to get choked up , because this is my first pet , and she passed away two years ago .
that &apos;s not something that you &apos;re going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels , and people are excited about it .
i would spend hours looking at just the connections , saying , &quot; oh , the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there . &quot;
and i remember instantly : i am in germany in this -- i had to go for a one-day trip .
they actually are a fish that is endothermic -- powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal .
the result is whether you &apos;re looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population , there &apos;s been tremendous decline on both sides , as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950 .
we &apos;re putting them together in unusual ways , and this is taking us into the ocean realm like never before .
so in a program called tag-a-giant we &apos;ve actually gone from ireland to canada , from corsica to spain .
in this case , we &apos;re actually going to measure the fish .
the center of the atlantic where the mixing is , i could imagine a policy that lets canada and america fish , because they manage their fisheries well , they &apos;re doing a good job .
they get returned , and when they get returned , here on a nasa numerical ocean you can see bluefin in blue go across their corridor , returning to the western pacific .
and now with google &apos;s oceans , we can actually put a white shark in that ocean .
and usually when i tell people i &apos;m an artist , they just look at me and say , &quot; do you paint ? &quot;
i was like , &quot; no , no . i &apos;m pretty certain there were no explosives .
and there was a sincere concern there .
see that ? they won &apos;t let me on a plane with that , but they &apos;ll give it to me on the plane .
sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
and really , it &apos;s not the most user-friendly interface .
no one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot;
so it holds onto the very last point .
there is an airbnb host on almost every main street in paris .
and then he happened to stumble across a post about taskrabbit .
how do we stop people who &apos;ve behaved badly in one community doing so under a different guise ?
i was essentially a ghost in the system .
let me give you one example from the world of recruiting , where reputation data will make the résumé seem like an archaic relic of the past .
you all know the truth of what i &apos;m going to say .
we collected data on problems with social gradients , the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder .
it comes from the world values survey .
that relationship is not mainly driven by more crime .
but another really important difference is how they get their greater equality .
i think i &apos;m looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality .
what about causality ?
despite the advanced technology , it &apos;s not reaching the people who need it most .
so at d-rev , we &apos;ve done some other projects , and we looked at three things that we really believe gets technologies to customers , to users , to people who need it .
it clicks .
ours is 79 percent , and we &apos;re hoping to get that higher .
and it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
all they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hustles .
and third of all , it &apos;s so sharp , it just cuts .
so , ok .
but it really changes the way you think .
there &apos;s something i call the visceral level of processing , and there will be visceral-level design .
that &apos;s why the global knives are so neat .
and the third level is reflective , which is , if you like the superego , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the senses , doesn &apos;t control the muscles .
so that &apos;s the new me .
that seemed a little damning , and i tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure , or with the availability of electricity , and things like that .
if you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies , then you don &apos;t need an alternative education .
and then , as he was doing that , he made an accidental click by hitting the touchpad -- you &apos;ll see him do that .
so then i measured , and they were using 200 english words with each other -- mispronounced , but correct usage -- words like exit , stop , find , save , that kind of thing , not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations .
basic windows functions , browsing , painting , chatting and email , games and educational material , music downloads , playing video .
they don &apos;t have a way to determine which way to answer this question ; perhaps none of us do .
sugata mitra : kids can teach themselves
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; carne , you have to be very clever to be a diplomat . &quot;
i mean it was very dramatic diplomacy .
the third reason , i won &apos;t go into .
and i gave it up .
and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service .
and watching ? what if !
i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the al-shabaab militia in somalia .
and of course , nothing happened -- nobody did anything .
and it serves you the 404 page .
joey !
here in america , people actually love tv .
why has television entertainment evolved the way it has ?
right at the end of the 60s , moral ambiguity is going up , inspiration is kind of on the wane .
it means in the 1966 television season , the &quot; smothers brothers &quot; came out of nowhere .
incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts : unemployment .
we &apos;re animals , we need our moms .
these sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now , and i realize that all of my other students are in the same boat , that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook , but not one of them really understood the main ideas .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they &apos;re following different instructions .
right ? i mean , because god forbid somebody have fun when they &apos;re learning science .
and that guy &apos;s like , &quot; actually , it was 87.3 miles . &quot;
make me laugh . make me care .
in 1902 , the great american psychologist william james wrote about the many varieties of religious experience .
and that bringing them together opens up the possibility of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences .
and once people circle around some sacred object or value , they &apos;ll then work as a team and fight to defend it .
in other words , charles darwin believed in group selection .
there &apos;s a mutation in the gene and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy .
and the most cohesive hives won , just as darwin said .
i mean that we evolved to see sacredness all around us and to join with others into teams and circle around sacred objects , people and ideas .
and this explains the extraordinary resonance of this simple metaphor conjured up nearly 400 years ago .
on the outside it looks like a very typical garage , a nice garage .
and so there is a good reason for this .
this , as many of you have probably guessed , is a recently emptied beer can in portugal .
this is for a book by &quot; metropolis . &quot;
if you &apos;ve had any design courses , they would teach you you can &apos;t read this .
and i only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden , and it was done right after 9 / 11 .
poster for atlantic center for the arts , a school in florida .
i just have a feeling this kid &apos;s been there for a week , you know .
yeah , he jumps out of buildings . it &apos;s -- unfortunately , this one works , kind of , as a spread .
you have to utilize who you are in your work .
david carson : design and discovery
and i &apos;m , this morning , going to talk about this for the first time .
those are the general approaches to life . that &apos;s one way to look at life on earth today .
and again , my question is , what does technology want ?
but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom , those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made . that does not happen in biology .
we &apos;ve heard about this and that . but i actually went back and took what i could find , the examples in history where there have been prohibitions against technology , and then i tried to find out when they came back in , because they always came back in . and it turns out that the time , the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited , is decreasing over time . and that basically , you can delay technology , but you can &apos;t kill it . so this makes sense , because in a certain sense what culture is , is the accumulation of ideas .
differences , freedom , choices , possibilities .
and so i think that we should embrace technology because it is an essential part of our journey in finding out who we are .
now , the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at , but they didn &apos;t really interact with people .
if you &apos;re a wildlife filmmaker and you &apos;re going out into the field to film animals , especially behavior , it helps to have a fundamental background on who these animals are , how they work and , you know , a bit about their behaviors .
if you &apos;re going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals , you might as well pick one that &apos;s fairly common .
and this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees f.
and you go back , and i &apos;m at home , and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; okay , what can i shoot ...
i &apos;ve been to a lot of lectures where , at the end of it , inevitably , one of the first questions that comes up is , &quot; but , but what can i do ?
and it &apos;s my hope that some of these &quot; hope spots &quot; can be in the deep ocean , an area that has historically been seriously neglected , if not abused .
we pass it down from generation to generation .
now my perspective is a particularly -- -- my perspective is a particularly american perspective .
it &apos;s now more than 82 percent .
and if you have a serious theory , you should be able to predict when google is going to go bust .
what is plotted here is metabolic rate -- how much energy you need per day to stay alive -- versus your weight , your mass , for all of us bunch of organisms .
don &apos;t know . we will discuss that .
just to show you what we plotted , here is income , gdp -- gdp of the city -- crime and patents all on one graph .
and in fact , if you compare it to data , it fits very well with the development of cities and economies .
that red line is from the theory .
kids in the 12th grade : not exactly all that enthusiastic about the american government system .
and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us .
so we did this project , and this is one of the artifacts of the project .
ask them really interesting questions .
this is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
and this is matched in every industrialized , wealthy country in the world .
so today &apos;s reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life .
we heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
this is a horse . the horse is not in pain .
and what i &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient .
so you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
it &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
alan russell studies regenerative medicine -- a breakthrough way of thinking about disease and injury , using a process that can signal the body to rebuild itself .
thank you so very much for having me here today .
you know , she &apos;s only half jewish .
well , i don &apos;t know how else to say it to you , so i &apos;ll just say it my way : the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the , you know , the bankers and the wall street . you know it .
and i &apos;m just trying not to panic and freak out . so i like , take a deep breath .
that &apos;s very good . i love that .
but , you know , i am originally from india , and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california , originally , i was very pleased and , frankly , relieved because , you know , i am a human rights advocate .
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s bad , but i told him , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with a chinese woman ? &quot;
thank you . xie xie .
thank you all very much . it was lovely .
and what really drives me is a vision of the future that i think we all share .
so i figured i needed to learn a little bit more about business , so i went to stanford business school and studied there .
and she started it about 10 years ago , and today , she educates over a quarter million african girls .
in 2005 , we launched our first slate of films , &quot; murder ball , &quot; &quot; north country , &quot; &quot; syriana &quot; and &quot; good night and good luck . &quot;
it was also a pretty good year for this guy .
it &apos;s been a real honor . thank you .
and like i tell my family , and my wife reminds me every time , &quot; you &apos;re risking your life , you know , every time you go to that country . &quot;
now , if something like this , which has happened in the u.k. , that &apos;s where they go . this is the intensive care unit in which i work .
so what we going to do now ?
no ? yes ? doesn &apos;t matter , it worked .
apart from the awards it &apos;s won , it &apos;s portable and it &apos;s certified . it &apos;s registered , the mhra -- and the ce mark , for those who don &apos;t know , for europe , is the equivalent of the fda in the u.s.
i have to serve . &quot;
in johannesburg , i had the opportunity to play to a mainly white , middle-class south african audience who ended up in tears because i use film clips that really touch the heart , the whole nature , of this terrible tragedy that is taking place , that people are tending to avoid , because they are fatigued , and they really don &apos;t quite know what the solutions are .
at this point in her life , she &apos;s suffering with full-blown aids and had pneumonia .
on january 24th , apple computer will introduce macintosh .
and many of the agents shredded as many of the documents as they could and left them behind in piles .
and that &apos;s done in part with the help from western technology .
after all , companies didn &apos;t stop polluting groundwater as a matter of course , or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course , just because executives woke up one day and decided it was the right thing to do .
so what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime ?
well , he would turn to people who were called , rather prosaically by sociologists , privatized law enforcement agencies .
six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade .
and remember , 20 of these speed boats were coming across the adriatic every single night .
since the beginning of globalization , the global narcotics market has expanded enormously .
and it &apos;s actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it &apos;s not so much the technology .
it is a major economic force and we need to take it very , very seriously .
the ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees ; our ancestors went out onto the plain .
and now it &apos;s whipped away from under you .
you must never do that again . &quot;
but you can say this : all the apes and all the monkeys are capable of walking on two legs , if they want to , for a short time .
and the ironic thing about it is that they are not staving off the aquatic theory to protect a theory of their own , which they &apos;ve all agreed on , and they love .
the water is lovely .
and it &apos;s not easy to change their minds .
&quot; dear sir , good day , compliments of the day , and my best wishes to you and family . i know this letter will come to you surprisingly , but let it not be a surprise to you , for nature has a way of arriving unannounced , and , as an adage says , originals are very hard to find , but their echoes sound louder . so i decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if i have to entrust any amount of money under your custody .
and that &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
i &apos;m obsessed with email . i get a lot of it .
it &apos;s true . some people say to me , they say , &quot; ze , you &apos;re doing all this stuff , this internet stuff , and you &apos;re not making any money .
we &apos;re in a culture of guru-ship . it &apos;s so hard to use some software because , you know , it &apos;s unapproachable , people feel like they have to read the manual .
but it &apos;s peripheral activities , like these , that allow people to get together , doing fun things .
how about you get on the phone ?
paragraph number two : you may actually have to just get very blunt and say what &apos;s really on your mind .
omar ahmad : political change with pen and paper
so i make other hats as well .
so i made a wearable wall that i could wear as a backpack .
and so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material that serves to mediate the difference in temperature between the human body and the glacial ice .
all right , so i go back from ted , and then the following week , i &apos;m invited to a dinner party in washington , d.c. , where i know that i &apos;ll be meeting a number of conservative intellectuals , including yuval levin , and to prepare for the meeting , i read this article by levin in national affairs called &quot; beyond the welfare state . &quot;
to understand why this is happening to us , and what we can do about it , we need to learn more about moral psychology .
now that process feels great . it feels really satisfying .
you know , ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale .
you step out of line , you get punished .
rising inequality like this is associated with so many problems for a democracy .
and then there &apos;s everybody else : the children who don &apos;t benefit from a stable marriage , who don &apos;t have as much invested in them , who don &apos;t grow up in a stable environment , and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph .
now this is a social disaster , and liberals are very concerned about this .
so , i &apos;m interested in the use of metabolic materials for the practice of architecture .
so , bottom-up materials actually exist today .
what we need it to do is to be creatively crafted around the wooden piles .
i &apos;ve spent hundreds of days in psychiatric hospitals .
that is , at best , i was expected to live in a board and care , and work at menial jobs .
several years ago , i decided to write down my experiences and my personal journey , and i want to share some more of that story with you today to convey the inside view .
continuing with the writings : &quot; the next morning i went to my professor &apos;s office to ask for an extension on the memo assignment , and i began gibbering unintelligably as i had the night before , and he eventually brought me to the emergency room .
we don &apos;t like to be strapped down to a bed and left to suffer for hours any more than he would .
hundreds of thousands with thoughts , interdiction . &apos; &apos; elyn , do you feel like you &apos;re dangerous to yourself or others ?
the better we understand these illnesses , the better the treatments we can provide , and the better the treatments we can provide , the more we can offer people care , and not have to use force .
and then i decided i &apos;d dedicate my life to saving one million people every year .
do you know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people ?
this is prickly pear creek .
most of you will be happy to know that the rest of the presentation &apos;s free , and some of you &apos;ll be happy to know that it involves beer .
we pay them to leave their water in-stream .
last september of 2011 , i started an online magazine for teenage girls called rookiemag.com.
i got about 3,000 emails .
perhaps something very naughty .
it &apos;s sort of a funny pattern .
what does that mean ?
so , having said all that , what is the secret formula for brewing compassion in the corporate setting ?
the idea here is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time .
in 1994 , i walked into a prison in cambodia , and i met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
but one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
i was recently in egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . the police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . they were torturing everybody all the time . &quot;
and on december 4 , he organized three thousand members of the youth communist league , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
thank you .
so , everybody &apos;s always suggesting new humble masterpieces , and at moma we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces .
they tried to make a toddler &apos;s gas mask in such a way that the toddler can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important .
instead , she said , &quot; no , no . work and leisure can be together . &quot;
but the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that the ultimate shelter is your sense of self , and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic .
many of you might know that the potato chip chair by charles and ray eames comes exactly from that kind of instance : fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden .
we &apos;re not the only ones .
and i remember thinking , i mean , why don &apos;t these guys just take me to a cheap school ?
and i &apos;m pretty much the one who figured it out , because i was a nerd .
this is the damage it causes .
and going back to the point i was trying to make , this is the swahili wikipedia .
with two paychecks , or three paychecks , i could solve a lot of my family &apos;s problems .
another thing is that these leaders are a reflection of our society .
and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me , i am able to lift all those people .
we just need a push .
i nearly died , was in a coma , stayed at the hospital for two years , and underwent 36 surgeries to be able to walk again .
over 60,000 people came to the start line , all wearing white t-shirts with no political slogans .
we are now one of the largest running events in the middle east , but most importantly , it is a platform for hope and cooperation in an ever-fragile and unstable part of the world .
he told me that there had been two deaths ; the mother and child both had died .
now we knew we had to design something which she could use .
and by the time i &apos;m done , in 2020 , when the who publishes the data again , this is going to be the map of anemia .
now , when i got this , i was -- press caps lock -- absolutely freaked out , okay ?
and , on the left , riley .
no cities like you see today in doha or dubai or abu dhabi or kuwait or riyadh .
it &apos;s 1.7 million people .
so that is our lake , if you can see it .
is there a sustainable solution ?
i &apos;ll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and is actually changing the world , and whose name is people power .
and everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young , mainly secular people step out to do the change . guess what ? they didn &apos;t watch the demographics .
so unity is a big thing , and this can be achieved .
this is dynamics between fear and apathy on one side and enthusiasm and humor on another side .
we are watching the great example of something else the internet can do .
i woke up the morning after i gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life .
and i said , &quot; remember when we &apos;d leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend &apos;s answering machine ?
vulnerability is not weakness .
i am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
here &apos;s why .
you know why this place is amazing ?
the thing to understand about shame is it &apos;s not guilt .
i can bring home the bacon , fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you &apos;re a man . &quot;
and to get out from underneath it , to find our way back to each other , we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we &apos;re parenting , the way we &apos;re working , the way we &apos;re looking at each other .
they fly , not with rotating components , so they fly only by flapping their wings .
with a split wing we get the lift at the upper wing , and we get the propulsion at the lower wing .
if we add to that the many of us here now who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses , then almost one in five indians will require eye care , a staggering 200 million people .
larry brilliant : he kept talking about mcdonalds and hamburgers , and none of it made any sense to us .
so i think we have a process by which we can really penetrate into the market and reach everyone who needs it , and in this process of using technology , make sure that most don &apos;t need to come to the base hospital .
but this really requires going beyond what we do , or what we have done , if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness .
and i &apos;m sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these .
so you move around the content on a display , but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device .
think of a hamster in the pocket .
they seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair .
in fact , i now call the underwater wheelchair &quot; portal , &quot; because it &apos;s literally pushed me through into a new way of being , into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness .
and bp was hardly our first experience of this in recent years .
another explanation that you often hear for recklessness is hubris .
but this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature .
there will always be another frontier .
it &apos;s not even mining .
you see , for some people , their savior is a guy in a flowing robe .
ted is about invention , let &apos;s be honest . right ? dh : yeah , it is .
oh , good . all right .
having a little bit of richard time . that &apos;s nice , that &apos;s good .
bf : that &apos;s cool . i always wanted to try that .
bf : no , it &apos;s a hassle . traveling too much .
dh : may we have our jumping music please ?
and believe it or not , you don &apos;t win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups .
dh : wow ! what a great trick , barry !
dh : ... to back .
the thing he designed was this monstrosity here , the analytical engine . now , just to give you an idea of this , this is a view from above .
and there &apos;s not just one of these , there &apos;s many of them .
this is a program written in a particular style .
it did have a ram pack .
i have to kill a frenchman when i come back at home ?
like al gore told you , two billion people live on the water from the glacier of himalaya .
we have done five thousand interviews .
at the moment , my family is very poor , my life here in shenzhen is just about showing myself that i can earn more and to let my parents stay and have something to live on .
i &apos;m very proud to show you the teaser .
we haven &apos;t yet understood that we &apos;re going at a much faster pace than the planet can sustain .
women have two copies of that big x chromosome ; men have the x and , of course , that small copy of the y.
so the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year .
their mom is a very brave woman who didn &apos;t believe that the symptoms weren &apos;t matching up , and through some heroic efforts and a lot of internet searching , she was able to convince the medical community that , in fact , they had something else .
the prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic is upon us today .
do you want to see whether you &apos;re genetically compatible with your girlfriend ? sure .
you have bigger clan gatherings and so on .
so i &apos;m thinking , you know , this procedure hasn &apos;t changed in about 40 years .
adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow , which we &apos;ve been using as a form of stem-cell therapy for over 40 years .
for a coral , branching into different copies is the most natural thing in the world .
this energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles , with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties .
a particle that hasn &apos;t been seen yet , but we &apos;re pretty sure exists , is the higgs particle , which gives masses to all these other particles .
whenever particles interact , nature keeps things in a perfect balance along all four of these charge directions .
we want to find all the particles and forces that make a complete picture of our universe .
the pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space is exquisitely beautiful , and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions between these elementary particles , each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape .
well , pretty bad .
but i also greatly enjoy the company of hyper-intelligent people .
but thank you so much for coming . that was absolutely fascinating .
mr. wurzel . the female has her first baby when she &apos;s 11 or 12 .
&quot; how can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees , when the people living around the national park are struggling to survive ? &quot;
today , we are developing what we call the greater gombe ecosystem .
we have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses , so called , leading to climate change .
we have a choice . every one of us in this room , we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make .
hope . that &apos;s the question i get asked as i &apos;m going around the world : &quot; jane , you &apos;ve seen so many terrible things , you &apos;ve seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million , at the turn of the century , to no more than 150,000 now , and the same with so many other animals .
this change , this change . to see change that we must have if we care about the future .
i &apos;m a visual artist , and i &apos;m also one of the co-founders of the plastic pollution coalition .
so i came together with a group of other people who were all looking at this issue , and we created the plastic pollution coalition .
artist dianna cohen shares some tough truths about plastic pollution in the ocean and in our lives -- and some thoughts on how to free ourselves from the plastic gyre .
so one important difference is that it &apos;s totally mobile .
but it &apos;s not perfect yet , it &apos;s very much a work in progress .
aicha el-wafi : good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
i talk against violence , against terrorism .
you have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous .
i invented lifesaver bottle because i got angry .
i spent all the time setting this up , so i guess i should .
replace the top .
diseases spread . more resources are required .
with 20 billion dollars , everyone can have access to safe drinking water .
we have seen lateral shifts of power -- the power of greece passed to rome and the power shifts that occurred during the european civilizations -- but we are seeing something slightly different .
it will actually happen by the powerful coming together and making treaty-based systems , treaty-based agreements , to govern that global space .
it &apos;s going to be quite grumpy as china begins to democratize her society after liberalizing her economy .
now we have to create the g20 .
lehman brothers goes down , the whole lot collapses .
it used to be the case that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe , i was safe ; if my country was more powerful than their country , i was safe ; my alliance , like nato , was more powerful than their alliance , i was safe .
they &apos;ve probably heard of the south beach diet , or the atkins diet .
biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation , the age when your children have children .
and research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
and in the northern part of the main island , this is ground zero for world longevity .
but , like sardinia , okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity .
and i asked her what it felt like to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter .
for 24 hours every week , no matter how busy they are , how stressed out they are at work , where the kids need to be driven , they stop everything and they focus on their god , their social network , and then , hardwired right in the religion , are nature walks .
i &apos;m probably the only person you &apos;ll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the sahara desert without sunscreen .
they have vocabulary for sense of purpose , ikigai , like the okinawans .
he did it because he couldn &apos;t afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one .
so for now , they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and patents only universities and corporations have access to .
&#91; &quot; paper speakers &quot; &#93; what we &apos;re seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet .
but no , this guy isn &apos;t slowing down .
in the future , with cars exchanging data with each other , we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind , to the right and left , all at the same time , bird &apos;s eye view , we will actually be able to see into those cars .
what happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ?
and i think it &apos;s going to be a great thing .
we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say , you &apos;re crazy , don &apos;t do that , you &apos;re going kill the guy .
and a third .
we don &apos;t want to do that to our students .
no life , from the smallest life to everybody here , would be possible without these little micro-machines .
three : i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
but i felt out of control of my life .
and i cried .
now , when i was a young man -- 40 years ago , the country was very , very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty .
so they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country , in every village of the country .
we had relay races with condoms , we had children &apos;s condom-blowing championship .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry . come over and i &apos;ll do the whole lot of you . &quot;
and here , every media person had to be trained for hiv .
and these were the condoms that we introduced .
we all need to help .
and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand -- &quot; coffee and condoms . &quot;
so a couple .
if i get in front of romo here .
this is actually something that one of our engineers , dom , built in a weekend .
all stories interest me , and some haunt me until i end up writing them .
the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics .
she replied , &quot; posture . my back is always straight , and i don &apos;t make old people &apos;s noises . &quot;
she names the twins after the camp &apos;s commanders to gain their favor , and feeds them with black tea because her milk cannot sustain them .
call it aphrodite , or venus , or bimbo , or whatever you want ; the name doesn &apos;t matter , as long as we understand what it is about , and we support it .
they are the poorest of the poor .
no museum or gallery in the united states , except for the new york gallery that carries botero &apos;s work , has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison .
isabel allende : tales of passion
it is a very useful concept , but behaviorally , it may not exactly explain what people do the first time they play these types of economic games or in situations in the outside world .
what happens with these one- and two-step types ?
so they have a chance of -- they bicker and disagree and end up with less money .
we share more genes with them than zebras do with horses .
the chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers .
it &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
a billion of us are obese , while a further billion starve .
and the food obviously went off very quickly .
but also you have to imagine it full of food .
now it &apos;s anonymous .
because it &apos;s an ideal . it &apos;s an imaginary thing . we can &apos;t have it .
it &apos;s a greenhouse , where kids get told all about food and growing their own food .
every day , in a city the size of london , 30 million meals are served . but where does all the food come from ? architect carolyn steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city , and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world .
and so we have a choice , it seems to me .
and also see that it demands acute intelligence , not just a gooey feeling .
i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling , replicating and repairing themselves .
and i think it really brings to light : is this really scalable ?
it &apos;s directly embedded ; there &apos;s no external instructions .
and i was there to honor a great 20th century explorer , roy chapman andrews .
so basically we had automobiles , but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .
a little over a hundred years ago , people were unaware of viruses , the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet .
all you &apos;ve got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back , and you won &apos;t see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet . and if you go further than that , you &apos;ll see the sun , the solar system , and the stars and so on .
they &apos;re called &quot; quasars . &quot; quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object .
our location is saturated with evidence , and also with matter and energy .
i think he &apos;s going to talk about that later in the conference .
and with problems that we are not aware of yet , the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope , not just of solving problems , but of survival .
that &apos;s the kind of rules that the cellphone company that nelson purchases his telephony from operates under .
what haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak .
one of the zones next to hong kong has a city called shenzhen .
people can come live under the new charter , but no one is forced to live under it .
now , where else might this model be tried ?
what university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual .
how can a struggling country break out of poverty if it &apos;s trapped in a system of bad rules ? economist paul romer unveils a bold idea : &quot; charter cities , &quot; city-scale administrative zones governed by a coalition of nations .
it turns out , almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors , and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication .
our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995 , and that from mycoplasma genitalium .
basically , any virus that &apos;s been sequenced today -- that genome can be made .
so we know lots of different pathways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 , and can capture that back .
it &apos;s about time . end sequence . take one .
they were self-confident and determined . and the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were future-focused rather than present-focused .
developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do .
we are drowning in news .
britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
and it pains me that i can &apos;t tell you all that we have learned with cassini .
it &apos;s cold , it &apos;s eerie , it &apos;s misty , it might be raining , and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner .
so it was -- i mean , i &apos;m getting goose bumps just talking about it .
but still , there was no sign in our images , or even in the huygens &apos; images , of any large , open bodies of fluids .
in other words , we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms .
so i &apos;m here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank , gaza and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be palestine .
it &apos;s like fallujah . shooting everywhere .
in the course of taking my film to villages in the west bank , in gaza and in east jerusalem , i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation .
millions of people were in severe need of help .
as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped . this slows the delivery of aid after a disaster -- and hides the economic potential of unused lands and unknown roads . in this short talk , google &apos;s lalitesh katragadda demos map maker , a group map-making tool that people around the globe are using to map their world .
so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment ?
but now as the rat explores around , each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid .
they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding , for example .
all i did was codify it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simplest idea .
that &apos;s how most marketing is done , that &apos;s how most sales is done and that &apos;s how most of us communicate interpersonally .
nobody bought one .
and the best we can muster up is , &quot; i don &apos;t know . it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot;
they had no money ; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop ; not a single person on the wright brothers &apos; team had a college education , not even orville or wilbur ; and the new york times followed them around nowhere .
and i love asking businesses , &quot; what &apos;s your conversion on new business ? &quot;
from the time tivo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day , they are the single highest-quality product on the market , hands down , there is no dispute .
in fact , some of his ideas were bad .
and it &apos;s those who start with &quot; why &quot; that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .
they said , &quot; every day we have patients that come into the clinic -- child has an ear infection , i prescribe antibiotics .
forty-five years after geiger , health leads has to reinvent the prescription for basic resources .
do you have safe housing ? &quot;
so it &apos;s a brutal winter in the northeast , your kid has asthma , your heat just got turned off , and of course you &apos;re in the waiting room of the er , because the cold air triggered your child &apos;s asthma .
so mia lozada is chief resident of internal medicine at ucsf medical center , but for three years as an undergraduate she was a health leads volunteer in the clinic waiting room at boston medical center .
and most of all , i believe that when we measure healthcare , it will be , not by what the system was , but by what we chose it to be .
piracy is also very active in the strait of malacca .
crew of four . sophisticated communications sweep .
why ? because the taliban withheld education during the period of time in which these men and women would have learned to read .
here you see baseball players .
thank you .
watch it as it rotates back again . and this is a very bright audience , all right ? see if you can stop it from happening , even though you know 100 percent it &apos;s true that -- bam ! you can &apos;t undo it . what does that tell you about yourselves ? we &apos;re going to do it again . no doubt about it . see if you can stop it from happening . no . it &apos;s difficult .
well , there &apos;s analog and digital . thought that was appropriate here .
here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman -- and there you have the length of life in years .
we are looking down in the archive , and when we are down into 1820 , there is only austria and sweden that can produce numbers .
about 1957 here , the health of the united states is the same as the philippines .
we have to look over generations to understand it .
but it &apos;s not really that easy , that it &apos;s all a good story .
this family earns about one dollar per day .
and these two young farmers , they are girls now -- because the parents are dead from hiv and aids -- they discuss with a trained agronomist .
we have to know a little more about the world .
it was the government that made law function finally .
and remember , please remember my main message , which is this : the seemingly impossible is possible .
i met the last air force general who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat .
we did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks .
but we have trouble accessing our outcomes .
i &apos;m going to distinguish between what i call front half and back half .
we should have had 250,000 troops streaming into iraq on the heels of that leviathan sweeping towards baghdad .
this is why it matters to the military .
i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s .
we connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay .
but here &apos;s the promise you make to the american public , to your own people , to the world .
but ultimately you &apos;re going to civilianize it , probably two thirds .
bombers , fighters go over here .
in this bracingly honest talk , international security strategist thomas barnett outlines a post-cold war solution for the foundering u.s. military that is both sensible and breathtaking in its simplicity : break it in two .
the problem is absolutely soluble , and even soluble in a way that &apos;s reasonably cheap .
here &apos;s mount pinatubo in the early &apos; 90s . that put a whole bunch of sulfur in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud .
this topic is also old .
i &apos;ll tell you very quickly how the effect works .
because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .
you might argue about the sanity of it , but the leverage is real .
i &apos;ll leave you with three questions , and then one final quote .
dr. edith widder -- she &apos;s now at the ocean research and conservation association -- was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here on the screen .
bingo ! now i &apos;m told that &apos;s not just a squid phenomenon with males , but i don &apos;t know .
just an amazing animal , it can change color and texture to match the surroundings . watch him blend right into this algae .
we like our suffering because it &apos;s so good when it ceases for a while . &quot;
if i had to hear it 24 hours , non-stop , it might be very tiring .
we think that if we could gather this and that , all the conditions , something that we say , &quot; everything to be happy -- to have everything to be happy . &quot;
just the mere fact of doing that fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature .
another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions , and that &apos;s by looking at the very nature .
they do , like , three years &apos; retreat , where they do meditate 12 hours a day .
but they found that -- this is after three and a half hours in an fmri , it &apos;s like coming out of a space ship .
we can &apos;t overestimate the amount of despair that we are generating with places like this .
so how is that being accomplished here ?
and every year they fail to because they don &apos;t want to hurt i.m. pei &apos;s feelings .
it &apos;s not that complicated : buildings more than one story high , built out to the sidewalk edge , so that people who are , you know , all kinds of people can get into the building .
a lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in america was such a trauma that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city , city life , and everything connected with it .
these are the schools we are sending them to : the hannibal lecter central school , las vegas , nevada .
the dead malls : what are we going to do with them ?
in james howard kunstler &apos;s view , public spaces should be inspired centers of civic life and the physical manifestation of the common good . instead , he argues , what we have in america is a nation of places not worth caring about .
so i &apos;ve got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s .
this is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet .
it &apos;s got 96 sensors , 36 onboard computers , 100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code , packs more than 10 kilos of tnt in electrical onboard equivalent .
it will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago .
in fact , you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon .
if you try to do that for the moon , you &apos;re going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there .
bill stone : exploring deep caves
and so , you know , so got one secondhand 747 from boeing and gave it a go .
rb : again , we may have had problems finding customers .
rb : it &apos;s a tough job , isn &apos;t it ?
rb : philippe has done the -- yeah , quite a bit of it : the logos and he &apos;s building the space station in new mexico .
but , anyway , we managed to survive it .
i certainly would have failed iq tests .
so i don &apos;t think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really .
a lot of people would say there &apos;s no way that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses without knifing a few people in the back , you know , doing some ugly things .
and so we only need one , so we &apos;re hopeful .
i mean , it seems like you &apos;re still a little bit in the growth phases , you &apos;re still doing these incredible new plans .
